        Install
        -------
        
        .. code-block:: shell
        
           $ pip install -U magicdict
        
        Thread Safety
        -------------
        :code:`FrozenMagicDict` and its subclasses should be thread safe without additional
        locking. If any data races occurred, then that's a bug. Please file an issue
        with reproducing procedure.
        
        Usage
        -----
        :code:`MagicDict` should function like :code:`collections.OrderedDict` except
        :code:`move_to_end` is not defined and :code:`d[key]` always returns the first
        item.
        
        :code:`FrozenMagicDict` is an immutable version of :code:`MagicDict`.
        
        :code:`FrozenTolerantMagicDict` and :code:`TolerantMagicDict` are
        case-insensitive versions of :code:`FrozenMagicDict` and :code:`MagicDict`
        respectively.
        
        :code:`get_first`, :code:`get_last`, :code:`get_iter`, and :code:`get_list`:
        These methods are available in `FrozenMagicDict` and its subclasses.
        For more details, please read the comments of each method.
        
        :code:`add`:
        Method :code:`add` is available in :code:`MagicDict` and
        :code:`TolerantMagicDict`. This method is used as an substitution of
        :code:`dic[key] = value` as it can append a value to the
        dictionary without removing the existing one. Setting values like normal
        :code:`OrderedDict` will clear the stored value(s) if any.
