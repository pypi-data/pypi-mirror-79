    This transformer is the final step in the
    :class:`gtda.mapper.pipeline.MapperPipeline` objects created
    by :func:`gtda.mapper.make_mapper_pipeline`. It corresponds the last two
    arrows in `this diagram <../../../../_images/mapper_pipeline.svg>`_.

    This transformer is not intended for direct use.

    Parameters
    ----------
    min_intersection : int, optional, default: ``1``
        Minimum size of the intersection, between data subsets associated to
        any two Mapper nodes, required to create an edge between the nodes in
        the Mapper graph.

    store_edge_elements : bool, optional, default: ``False``
        Whether the indices of data elements associated to Mapper edges (i.e.
        in the intersections allowed by `min_intersection`) should be stored in
        the :class:`igraph.Graph` object output by :meth:`fit_transform`. When
        ``True``, might lead to a large :class:`igraph.Graph` object.

    Attributes
    ----------
    graph_ : :class:`igraph.Graph` object
        Mapper graph obtained from the input data. Created when :meth:`fit` is
        called.

        Parameters
        ----------
        X : list of list of tuple
            Data structure describing a cover of a dataset (e.g. as depicted in
            `this diagram <../../../../_images/mapper_pipeline.svg>`_) produced
            by the clustering step of a :class:`gtda.mapper.MapperPipeline`.
            Each sublist corresponds to a (non-empty) pullback cover set --
            equivalently, to a cover set in the filter range which has
            non-empty preimage. It contains triples of the form ``(\
            pullback_set_label, partial_cluster_label, node_elements)`` where
            ``partial_cluster_label`` is a cluster label within the pullback
            cover set identified by ``pullback_set_label``, and
            ``node_elements`` is an array of integer indices. To each pair
            ``(pullback_set_label, partial_cluster_label)`` there corresponds
            a unique node in the output Mapper graph. This node represents
            the data subset defined by the indices in ``node_elements``.

        y : None
            There is no need for a target in a transformer, yet the pipeline
            API requires this parameter.

        Returns
        -------
        graph : :class:`igraph.Graph` object
            Undirected Mapper graph according to `X` and `min_intersection`.
            Each node is an :class:`igraph.Vertex` object with attributes
            ``"pullback_set_label"``, ``"partial_cluster_label"`` and
            ``"node_elements"'``. Each edge is an :class:`igraph.Edge` object
            with a ``"weight"`` attribute which is equal to the size of the
            intersection between the data subsets associated to its two nodes.
            If `store_edge_elements` is ``True`` each edge also has an
            additional attribute ``"edge_elements"``.
