# CalliopeMini Stubs

Use this library to develop your python programs for the
[Calliope Mini](https://calliope.cc/)
using a state-of-the-art python IDE such as
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
on your computer.

This library only helps by providing documentation, type annotations and
function signatures.
It does not contain a simulator/emulator and it does not allow to transfer the
developed code to the Calliope Mini.

Make sure to install this only in a local virtual environment as some
libraries overwrite "system" libraries and thus make scripts that are not
intended to run on the Calliope Mini fail.


Please see
[the repository on GitHub](https://github.com/kopp/calliope-mini-stubs)
for how a simple step-by-step instruction how to use it.
