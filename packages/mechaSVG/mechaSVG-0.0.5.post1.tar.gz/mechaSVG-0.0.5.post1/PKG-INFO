Description: # mechaSVG
        
        mechaSVG is a python & tk application for creating good-looking energy profile diagrams as *Scalable Vector Graphics* or **'.svg'** files with various aesthetic options. The produced graphics can also be easily edited afterwards via an svg editor like Inkscape. Extra analysis for catalytic cycle diagrams include: Finding energy span, Turn Over Frequency (TOF) estimation from both energy span and *catalytic-flux law*, and estimating degree of TOF control of both intermediates and transition states.รยน\
