# mechaSVG
mechaSVG is a python & tk application for creating good-looking energy profile diagrams as *Scalable Vector Graphics* or **'.svg'** files with various aesthetic options. The produced graphics can also be easily edited afterwards via an svg editor like Inkscape. Extra analysis for catalytic cycle diagrams include: Finding energy span, Turn Over Frequency (TOF) estimation from both energy span and *catalytic-flux law*, and estimating degree of TOF control of both intermediates and transition states.¹\

## Latest updates

Support for ".xlsx" and ".txt" imports and exports added. Please refer to section "**Importing .txt and .xlsx**" for information about importing these file types.


## Preview

The following pictures ilustrate the usage of the graphical user interface and the corresponding output

### Graphical interface

### Output graphs

#### Example 1
![Graph 1](mechasvg/supl/example_1.svg)

#### Example 2
![Graph 2](mechasvg/supl/example_2.svg)

These svg graphs can be easily post edited to fit your needs using freely available svg editors like [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/).

## Installing & Running
The recommended installaion requires python 3.6 or above.

Installation can be done via:
```bash
python3 -m pip install mechasvg
```
The program can be run via:
```bash
python3 -m mechasvg
```

Alternatively, a windons 10 executable can be downloaded on the following link:
[mechaSVG-v004.exe](https://github.com/ricalmang/mechaSVG/releases/download/v.0.0.4/mechaSVG-v004.exe)

## Importing .txt and .xlsx
Data for mechaSVG can be inserted directly onto the user interface or be imported from xlsx and txt files.
Importing files can be done with the **Open** button on the user interface or by running the following command:
 ```bash
python3 /path/to/file/mechasvg.py /path/to/file/example.txt
```
###.txt files
Data for .txt imports should be writen in a plain text file like in the following example:
```bash
Structure_A_Name Free_energy Entalphy
Structure_B_Name Free_energy Entalphy
Structure_C_Name Free_energy 
Structure_D_Name Free_energy 
·
·
·
```
Please notice that no spaces are allowed on structure names or energies.\
The following example ilustrates how to populate data into multiple path tabs with a single txt file.
```bash
Path_A_Structure_A Free_energy Entalphy
Path_A_Structure_B Free_energy Entalphy
Path_A_Structure_C Free_energy Entalphy
Path_A_Structure_D Free_energy
#A
Path_B_Structure_A Free_energy
Path_B_Structure_B Free_energy
#B
·
·
·

```
Please note that only the following tab flags area available:
\#A, #B, #C, #D, #E, #F, #G and #H

###.xlsx files
Data for .xlsx imports should be writen starting at to left and top right cells (i.e. A1 cell). Every sheet will be consecutively atributed to a reaction path tab on mechaSVG.

 |       .xlsx              |  mechaSVG |
| :-------------------------: | :-------------------------:|
| ![.xlsx](mechasvg/supl/xlsx.gif)  | ![mechaSVG](mechasvg/supl/mechasvg.gif) |

.xlsx files can be generated using [LibreOffice Calc](https://www.libreoffice.org/) or Microsoft Excel.  


## How to cite
I don't actually require users to cite the software at all, so you can take any liberty in how or whether you cite it. However, a citation would greatly help to spread the visibility and adoption of this project which is my main goal.

If you intend to cite it, the following citation should suffice:
