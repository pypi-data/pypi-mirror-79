## Introduction

The Pipeline is a generic web request intelligence and data processing solution with the ability to add a range of 51Degrees and/or custom plug ins (Engines) 

## This package fiftyone_pipeline_core

This package definds the essential components of the Pipeline API such as `flow elements`, `flow data` and `evidence`. It also packages together JavaScript served by a pipeline and allows for client side requests for additional data populated by evidence from the client side.

It can be used on its own or with the following additional packages.

- **fiftyone_pipeline_engines** - Adds a specialized type of flow element called an engine which allows for additional features including an auto-updating data file for properties, a service called when a requested property is missing and a caching system.

Engines created by 51Degrees including:

- **fiftyone_devicedetection** - A device detection engine
- **fiftyone_location** - A geolocation lookup engine

Make use of the above along with the following additional packages:

- **fiftyone_pipeline_cloudrequestengine** - An engine used to make requests to the 51Degrees cloud service.
