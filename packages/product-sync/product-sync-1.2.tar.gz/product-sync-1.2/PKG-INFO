        ## Introduction
        
        CloudBlue Connect is a supply automation platform that manages your products and services, contracts, 
        ordering and fulfillment, usage and subscriptions. 
        
        It supports any product, from physical goods to cloud products, as well as any channel, including your 
        direct and indirect sales channels and internal procurement. 
        
        With its flexible APIs, it can connect to any commerce platform.
        
        Vendors can leverage CloudBlue Connect to:
        
        * Reduce the total cost of ownership for homegrown technology supporting their indirect channel
        * Standardize integrations with partners
        * Increase efficiencies and minimize redundancies by bridging their direct and indirect sales channels
        
        Service providers can use CloudBlue Connect to:
        
        * Define, manage and distribute any type of product (omni-product) through any channel (omni-channel)
        * Transform perpetual licensed products into a subscription model
        * Onboard new products into their portfolio quickly to build and deliver unique solutions to end customers
