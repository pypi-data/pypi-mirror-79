    Redis storage schema is optimized for higher performance.
    Previously Redis driver stored each tracing event under its own key,
    as result both list and get operations required full scan of the database.
    With the optimized schema traces are stored as Redis lists under a key
    equal to trace id. So list operation iterates only over unique
    trace ids and get operation retrieves content of a specified list.
    Note that list operation still needs to retrieve at least 1 event
    from the trace to get a timestamp.

    The optimized Redis driver is backward compatible: while new events are stored
    using new schema the driver can retrieve existing events using both old and new
    schemas.
