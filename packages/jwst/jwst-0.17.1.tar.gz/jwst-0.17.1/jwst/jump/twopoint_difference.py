"""
Two-Point Difference method for finding outliers in a 3-d ramp data cube.
The scheme used in this variation of the method uses numpy array methods
to compute first-differences and find the max outlier in each pixel while
still working in the full 3-d data array. This makes detection of the first
outlier very fast. We then iterate pixel-by-pixel over only those pixels
that are already known to contain an outlier, to look for any additional
outliers and set the appropriate DQ mask for all outliers in the pixel.
This is MUCH faster than doing all the work on a pixel-by-pixel basis.
