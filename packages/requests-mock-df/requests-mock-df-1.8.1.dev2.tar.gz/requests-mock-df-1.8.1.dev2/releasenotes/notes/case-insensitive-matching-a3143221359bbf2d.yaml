    It is now possible to make URL matching and request history not lowercase
    the provided URLs.
features:
  - You can pass case_sensitive=True to an adapter or set
    `requests_mock.mock.case_sensitive = True` globally to enable case
    sensitive matching.
upgrade:
  - It is recommended you add `requests_mock.mock.case_sensitive = True` to
    your base test file to globally turn on case sensitive matching as this
    will become the default in a 2.X release.
fixes:
  - Reported in bug \#1584008 all request matching is done in a case
    insensitive way, as a byproduct of this request history is handled in a
    case insensitive way. This can now be controlled by setting case_sensitive
    to True when creating an adapter or globally.
