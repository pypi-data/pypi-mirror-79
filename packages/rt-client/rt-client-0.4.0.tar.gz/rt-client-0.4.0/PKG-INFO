Description: rt-client
        #########
        
        The RT Client is a python library for interfacing with RT's REST API. The
        client uses `python-requests <http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/>`_
        and talks to the `V2 <https://github.com/bestpractical/rt-extension-rest2>`_ API.
        
        Sadly though the base API at present isn't feature complete and is in fact
        lacking some major functionality, as such we actually have based this client
        on our fork, which contains a collection of pull requests for the main API
        extension that have not yet been merged:
        https://github.com/catalyst-cloud/rt-extension-rest2/tree/catalyst-v1.06b
        
        We will update the client as and when the official extension is updated to
        match but until then know that our fork (and this client) are more feature
        complete.
        
        In the future we also intend to add a CLI which will use the library and offer
        a nice way of interacting with RT from the commandline based on the features
        the V2 API gives us.
