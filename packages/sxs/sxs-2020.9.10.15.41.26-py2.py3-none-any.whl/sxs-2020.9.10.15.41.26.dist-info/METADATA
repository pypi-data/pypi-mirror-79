This package provides a number of utilities for use by the SXS collaboration, and others who use our data.
For example, the `metadata` subpackage provides functions for reading and analyzing the metadata files
provided with SXS simulations for describing the physics they represent.  Another important subpackage is
`zenodo`, which provides handy functions for interacting with zenodo.org in general, and in particular our
collection of simulation data on that site.

A handy command-line interface is also installed when you install this package.  It enables direct calling to
any function in this package.  For example, if you want to upload a directory to Zenodo, you could use the
`sxs.zenodo.upload` function through python, or you could just run the command `sxs zenodo upload`.  Any
arguments to these functions should be passed immediately following the function name, followed by any keyword
arguments in the usual `--keyword=value` format.  Run `sxs --help` for more information.
