<h1>Pygeclip</h1>
A simple Python Package for seamless integeration with Pageclip API

<h2>Description</h2>
Pageclip provides seamless integeration for static html forms. 
The data is easily collected and managed on the Pageclip server.
They also provide a REST API for retrieval of the data in JSON 
and CSV format. 

**The Problem?**
They don't have a proper documentation for using the API with Python.
I faced a lot of issues in beginning and finally got it to work. So I 
made a simple package which you can use to retrieve the data from their API easily.

<h2>Usage</h2>
1. Make an instance of the class pgconn()
        
        item = pgconn("url", "api_key")
    
This takes two parameters, 
**The URL**
**Your api key**
You can refer to PageClip documentation for both (it's easily undestandable, they have great documentation!)
    
2. Call the data() function
        
        item.data()
        
This returns the data from the api in **json** format and you can use it do do your magic!    

<h3>Note</h3>
This is an initial commit. I will be adding all features in this package soon!


1: **Putting the data to the form through api**

2: **Retrieving and processing the data in CSV format**
