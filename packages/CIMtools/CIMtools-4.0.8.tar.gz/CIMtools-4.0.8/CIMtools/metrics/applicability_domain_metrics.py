def balanced_accuracy_score_with_ad(Y_true, Y_pred, AD):
    """
    The metric is used to optimize AD thresholds and their (hyper)parameters.
    This metric shows how well AD definition detects Y-outliers. First, property prediction errors are estimated
    in cross-validation for all reactions in a dataset. The reactions for which the absolute prediction error
    is higher than 3Ã—RMSE are identified as Y-outliers, while the rest are considered as Y-inliers.
    Y-Outliers (poorly predicted) that are predicted by AD definition as X-outliers (outside AD) are called
    true outliers (TO), while Y-inliers predicted by AD definition as X-inliers (within AD) are called
    true inliers (TI). False outliers (FO) are Y-inliers that are wrongly predicted by the AD definition
    as X-outliers, while false inliers (FI) are Y-outliers that are wrongly predicted by the AD definition
    as X-inliers. The quality of outliers/inliers determination can be assessed using an analogue
    of the balanced accuracy.

    Parameters
    ----------
    Y_true : array-like, shape = [n_samples]
             The target values (real numbers in regression).
    Y_pred : array-like, shape = [n_samples]
             The predicted values of Y_true.
    AD : array-like, shape = [n_samples]
         Array contains True (reaction in AD) and False (reaction residing outside AD).

    Returns
    -------
    balanced_accuracy : float
    """
    AD_true = abs(Y_true - Y_pred) <= 3 * sqrt(mean_squared_error(Y_true, Y_pred))

def rmse_score_with_ad(Y_true, Y_pred, AD):
    """
    The metric is used to optimize AD thresholds and their (hyper)parameters.
    This metric is the difference between RMSE of property prediction for reactions outside AD and within AD.
    The metric was first proposed by Sahigata et al [1]. Negative values indicate that the reactions detected
    X-outliers (outside AD) are predicted better than X-inliers (within AD), thus highlighting some possible
    drawbacks in the definition of interpolation space. Its positive values indicate a reliable partition
    for the reactions detected as inside and outside AD and higher predictive performance within
    AD as compared to outside it. If no reactions are left inside or outside AD, then OIR is considered equal to 0.

    Parameters
    ----------
    Y_true : array-like, shape = [n_samples]
             The target values (real numbers in regression).
    Y_pred : array-like, shape = [n_samples]
             The predicted values of Y_true.
    AD : array-like, shape = [n_samples]
         Array contains True (reaction in AD) and False (reaction residing outside AD).

    Returns
    -------
    difference between RMSE of property prediction for reactions outside AD and within AD : float
