        What is Jobpy?
        --------------
        
        Jobpy is a library built with Python to pull job postings from all over the internet.
        The idea behind is was to analyze the different characteristics of the job posting, like
        skills required, experience, etc. It can also be used to apply to the search jobs although
        the fetaure has not been released yet.
        
        
        Look how easy it is to use:
        
        ```
           [In]: from jobpy.search import cb_job_search as cb
           [In]: jobs_in_la = cb.start_search('software developer', 'Los Angeles')
           [In]: print(jobs_la)
           
           [Out]: 'software_developer_job_los_angeles.csv'
        ```
