The Lilt REST API enables programmatic access to the full-range of Lilt backend services including:   * Training of and translating with interactive, adaptive machine translation   * Large-scale translation memory   * The Lexicon (a large-scale termbase)   * Programmatic control of the Lilt CAT environment   * Translation memory synchronization  Requests and responses are in JSON format. The REST API only responds to HTTPS / SSL requests. ## Authentication Requests are authenticated via REST API key, which requires the Business plan.  Requests are authenticated using [HTTP Basic Auth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication). Add your REST API key as both the &#x60;username&#x60; and &#x60;password&#x60;.  For development, you may also pass the REST API key via the &#x60;key&#x60; query parameter. This is less secure than HTTP Basic Auth, and is not recommended for production use.   # noqa: E501
