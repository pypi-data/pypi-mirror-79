        EEA Versions is a versioning system based on a version ID to group certains
        objects and EffectiveDate to determine version number.
        
        .. note ::
        
          This add-on doesn't do anything by itself. It needs to be integrated by a
          developer within your own products. For reference you can check
          the `eea.sparql`_ package.

        Installation
        ============
        
        zc.buildout
        -----------
        If you are using `zc.buildout`_ and the `plone.recipe.zope2instance`_
        recipe to manage your project, you can do this:
        
        * Update your buildout.cfg file:
        
          * Add ``eea.versions`` to the list of eggs to install
          * Tell the `plone.recipe.zope2instance`_ recipe to install a ZCML slug
        
          ::
        
            [instance]
            ...
            eggs =
              ...
              eea.versions
        
            zcml =
              ...
              eea.versions
        
        * Re-run buildout, e.g. with::
        
          $ ./bin/buildout
        
        You can skip the ZCML slug if you are going to explicitly include the package
        from another package's configure.zcml file.

        ------------------
        * Feature: all permalinks logic moved under this package, e.g. ds_resolveuid
          [alecghica refs #76194]

          called now from any context

          [ichimdav refs #72875]
        
        9.2 - (2016-05-31)
        ------------------
        * Bug fix: reindex getVersionId when performing a revoke in order to ensure
          that the version viewlet no longer takes into consideration the revoked
          object as part of the previous versioning chain
          [ichimdav refs #72875]
        
        9.1 - (2016-05-27)
        ------------------
        * Feature: added prefix_language option for version object which if enabled
          allows you to have a language suffix for all versions
          [ichim-david refs #72521]
        * Feature: translated objects from LinguaPlone get version plus language prefix
          as version id if version object is defined in order to avoid adding a new
          prefixed object in case we have a new translation
          [ichim-david refs #72521]
        * Feature: migration now sets version plus language prefix as version id
          if version object is defined in order to avoid adding a new prefixed object
          in case we have a new translation
          [ichim-david refs #72521]

          [ichimdav refs #70786]

          [ichimdav refs #70786]
        
        8.1 - (2015-12-16)
        ------------------
        * Bug fix: reset relations on versioned objects as the paste seems to loose the
          relationship
          [ichimdav refs #31440]
        
        8.0 - (2015-11-03)
        ------------------
        * Feature: Performance improvement when creating new version
          by usign the patched manage_pasteObjects and so avoid the rename after

          [chiridra refs #14598]
        
        7.9 - (2015-10-05)
        ------------------
        * Change: fixed issue 2 - to have previous versions shown on all versions.
          [chiridra refs #28681]
        * Change: removed js code that dealt with hiding of the older versions, this was
          a design implementation that isn't generic and was moved to another eea theme
          package
          [ichimdav refs #27220]
        
        7.8 - (2015-08-18)
        ------------------
        * Change: Auto-include zcml within plone context in order to make this package
          work without having to add it within buildout zcml directive.
          [avoinea]
        
        7.7 - (2015-04-02)
        ------------------
        * Change: added missing commit for ticket 23017 which changes the portalMessage
          of older versions to archiveMessage
          [ichimdav refs #23017]
        
        7.6 - (2015-03-17)
        ------------------
        * Change: Switched to curl in the jenkins build install script
          [olimpiurob refs #22402]
        * Change: Changed fetch url for jenkins build install script to the install
          script from the main EEA CPB repository
          [olimpiurob refs #22402]
        * Change: added eea.versions.older viewlet with logic that was previously
          within eea.versions.status viewlet about displaying older revisions
          [ichimdav refs #23017]
        
        7.5 - (2014-12-23)
        ------------------
        * Feature: Ajax versioning is now checking if a version isn't already in
          progress in which case no new versioning is attempted until previous version
          call is terminated
          [ichim-david refs #22047]
        * Bug fix: Added browserlayer for viewlets, so don't throw error when
          eea.versions is installed but not activated yet.
          [szabozo0]
        
        7.4 - (2014-11-20)
        ------------------
        * Bug fix: Display also archived (expired) versions within versioning viewlet
          for anonymous users.
          [voineali refs #21515]
        
        7.3 - (2014-10-15)
        ------------------
        * Upgrade step: run SITE/@@updateCreationDate
          [ichim-david refs #21326]
        * Feature: added updateCreationDate BrowserView which will set the CreationDate
          to that of the EffectiveDate if the CreationDate is smaller than the
          EffectiveDate
          [ichim-david refs #21326]
        * Change: order of versions no longer takes into consideration that
          effective_date needs to be older than the creation date, opting to sort
          by effective_date if that is found on the object.
          This reverts the logic change done in ticket 20827
          [ichim-david refs #21326]
        * Bug fix: user must be able to create a new version with Add Portal
          Content permission. Semantically creating new versions means adding new
          content to the site. This way users can create new versions of published
          content which it may be not editable anymore.
          [demarant refs #21369]
        
        7.2 - (2014-09-15)
        ------------------
        * Bug fix: check if effective_date isn't smaller than that of the creation_date
          when returning the versions of an object and if so sort by creation_date
          since the order of the versions determine which is latest version
          [ichimdav refs #20827]
        
        7.1 - (2014-07-15)
        ------------------
        * Bug fix: fixed permission for @@can_version, it is now set to zope2.View
          instead of wrong ModifyPortalContent one.
          [ghicaale refs #20381]
        * Change: GetVersions class no longer requires a request which isn't found
          when class is called from plone.app.async
          [ichimdav refs #19859]
        * Bug fix: fix create new version ajax method when the operation takes
          too much time.
          [ghicaale refs #20193]
        
        7.0 - (2014-05-13)

        ------------------
        * Change: getLatestVersionUrl can now be called from the getLatestVersionUrl
          browser page
          [ichimdav refs #18316]
        
        6.8 - (2014-01-23)
        ------------------
