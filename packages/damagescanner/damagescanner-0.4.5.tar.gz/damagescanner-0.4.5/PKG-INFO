        # DamageScanner 
        
        Python toolkit for direct damage assessments for natural disasters.
        
        Please refer to the [ReadTheDocs](http://damagescanner.readthedocs.io/) of this project for the full documentation of all functions. 
        
        **Requirements:** [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/), [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [geopandas](http://geopandas.org/), [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), [rasterio](https://github.com/mapbox/rasterio), [tqdm](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm) 
        
        **Please note:** This package is still in development phase. In case of any problems, or if you have any suggestions for improvements, please raise an *issue*. 
        
        ## Background
        This package is (loosely) based on the original DamageScanner, which calculated potential flood damages based on inundation depth and land use using depth-damage curves in the Netherlands. The DamageScanner was originally developed for the 'Netherlands Later' project [(Klijn et al., 2007)](https://www.rivm.nl/bibliotheek/digitaaldepot/WL_rapport_Overstromingsrisicos_Nederland.pdf).  The original land-use classes were based on the Land-Use Scanner in order to evaluate the effect of future land-use change on flood damages. 
        
        This package aims to make this method widely available and for everyone to use. Next to a (generalized) function for estimating damages based on raster data, it also includes a damage assessment function using vector land-use data. 
        
        Even though the method is initially developed for flood damage assessments, it can calculate damages for any hazard for which you just require a fragility curve (i.e. a one-dimensional relation). 
        
        ## Installation
        
        1. Open the python environment in your command prompt or bash in which you want to install this package.
        2. Type ``pip install damagescanner`` and it should install itself into your python environment.
        3. Now you can import the package like any other package!
        
        OR:
        
        1. Clone the repository or download the package on your computer and extract the folder.
        2. Go to the DamageScanner folder in your command prompt or bash.
        3. Type ``python setup.py install`` and it should install itself into your python environment.
        4. Now you can import the package like any other package!
        
        ## To-do:
        * Make inputs for both the RasterScanner and VectorScanner more flexible. Catch common errors.
        * Make plotting functions more flexible.
        * Develop automated damage assessments using OpenStreetMap data.
