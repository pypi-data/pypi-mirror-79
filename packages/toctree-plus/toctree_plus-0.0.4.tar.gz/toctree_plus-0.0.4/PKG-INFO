        Installation
        --------------
        
        .. start installation
        
        ``toctree_plus`` can be installed from PyPI.
        
        To install with ``pip``:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
        	$ python -m pip install toctree_plus
        
        .. end installation
        
        Enable ``toctree_plus`` by adding ``"sphinxcontrib.toctree_plus"`` to the ``extensions`` variable in ``conf.py``:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
        	extensions = [
        		...
        		"sphinxcontrib.toctree_plus",
        		]
        
        For more information see https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/index.html#third-party-extensions .
        
        Configuration
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        There is currently only a single configuration option: ``toctree_plus_types``.
        This determines the directive types that appear in the toctree. The default value is ``{"class", "function", "method"}``.
