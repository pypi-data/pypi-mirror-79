## Presentation
The pushkin package wraps scikit-learn tools into ergonomic ready-to-use functions.

For now, pushkin implements three types of machine learning classifiers
- random forest classifier (sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier)
- multi-layer perceptron neural network (sklearn.neural\_network.MLPClassifier)
- K-nearest neighbors (sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier) 

## Requirements
The source code is written in Python 3.
The following packages are required :
- numpy
- matplotlib
- pandas
- scikit-learn

## Installation
The pushkin package may be installed from GitLab by cloning the repository :

`git clone https://gitlab.com/sybreton/pushkin.git`
