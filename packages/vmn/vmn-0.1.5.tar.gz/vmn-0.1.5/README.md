## Usage

```sh
cd to/your/repository
vmn -h

vmn init

# Examples:
vmn stamp -r patch <app-name>
# example for starting version 1.0.6.8 
vmn stamp -r minor -s 1.0.6.8 <app-name>
vmn stamp -r major <app-name>
vmn show <app-name>
vmn goto -v 1.0.1.0 <app-name>
```

### Concurrent builds

`vmn`  supports simultaneous builds. You can safely run multiple instances of `vmn`



## Installation

```sh
pip3 install vmn
```

## Why `vmn` is agnostic to application language?
It is the application's reposibility to actualy set the version number that is in the `ver.yml` file to the application's code during its build phase.
