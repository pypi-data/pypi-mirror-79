Description: # Decompose
        This module provides a method for decomposing strings containing latin diacretics, ligatures, 
        and other unusual latin letters into their appropriate ascii counterparts generally for the purpose
        of data for submission into systems requiring the usage of the ascii subset.
        
        ## Example
        ```python
        from decompose import decompose
        
        decompose('MÃ¡laga') # returns 'Malaga'
        ```
        
        ## Comments
        decompose.decompose() depends upon unicodedata.normalize() for most of its heavy lifting. 
        However, it also contains a lookup table (decompose.charmap) for those unicode characters that are
        not necessarily handled by normalize(). Any letter not handled by either normalize or charmap will
        be silently dropped.
