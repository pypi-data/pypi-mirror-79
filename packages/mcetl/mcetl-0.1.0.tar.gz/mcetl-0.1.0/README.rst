Installation
------------

Stable release
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To install mcetl, run this command in your terminal:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install mcetl

This is the preferred method to install mcetl, as it will always install the most recent stable release.


From Github
~~~~~~~~~~~

The sources for mcetl can be downloaded from the `Github repo`_.

You can clone the public repository:

.. code-block:: console

    $ git clone git://github.com/derb12/mcetl


Once you have a copy of the source, you can install it with:

.. code-block:: console

    $ python setup.py install


.. _Github repo: https://github.com/derb12/mcetl


Usage
-----

To use mcetl in a project::

    import mcetl


To use the peak fitting or plotting modules in mcetl, simply do::

    mcetl.launch_peak_fitting_gui()
    mcetl.launch_plotting_gui()


A window will then appear to select the data file(s) to be fitted or plotted.


Files for example data from characterization techniques can be created using::

    from mcetl import raw_data
    raw_data.generate_raw_data()


Data produced by the generate_raw_data function covers the following characterization techniques:

* X-ray diffraction (XRD)
* Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR)
* Raman spectroscopy
* Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)
* Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)


`Example programs`_  are available to show basic usage of mcetl. The examples include:

* Generating raw data
* Using the main GUI
* Using the peak fitting GUI
* Using the plotting GUI
* Reopening a figure saved with the plotting GUI

Future Plans
------------

Planned features for later releases:

Short term
~~~~~~~~~~

* Develop tests for all modules in the package.
* Switch from print statements to logging.
* Transfer documentation from PDF/Word files to automatic documentation with Sphinx.
* Improve usage when opening existing Excel files.


Long term
~~~~~~~~~

* Add more plot types to the plotting gui, including bar charts, categorical plots, and 3d plots.
* Make peak fitting more flexible by allowing more options or user inputs.
* Improve overall look and usability of all GUIs.
