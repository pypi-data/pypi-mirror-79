        Introduction
        ------------
        
        CADISHI \-- CAlculation of DIStance HIstograms \-- is a software package
        that enables scientists to compute (Euclidean) distance histograms
        efficiently. Any sets of objects that have 3D Cartesian coordinates may
        be used as input, for example, atoms in molecular dynamics datasets or
        galaxies in astrophysical contexts. CADISHI drives the high-performance
        kernels pydh (CPU) and cudh (GPU, optional) to do the actual histogram
        computation. The kernels pydh and cudh are part of CADISHI and are
        written in C++ and CUDA.
