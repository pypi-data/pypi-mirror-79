# DiceMaths

This package is intented for performing basic statistical calculations on the outcomes of dice rolls within the context of various dice based games

## core.py

This file contains basic operations that can be used regardless of game-specific idiosyncracies (i.e whether rerolls can be rerolled)

## infinity.py

This file deals with operations for use on Corvus Belli's game Infinity. The key system is the idea of a contested roll, in which higher rolls beat lower ones, and can themselves be negated by critical hits.
