Description: # DiceMaths
        
        This package is intented for performing basic statistical calculations on the outcomes of dice rolls within the context of various dice based games
        
        ## core.py
        
        This file contains basic operations that can be used regardless of game-specific idiosyncracies (i.e whether rerolls can be rerolled)
        
        ## infinity.py
        
        This file deals with operations for use on Corvus Belli's game Infinity. The key system is the idea of a contested roll, in which higher rolls beat lower ones, and can themselves be negated by critical hits.
