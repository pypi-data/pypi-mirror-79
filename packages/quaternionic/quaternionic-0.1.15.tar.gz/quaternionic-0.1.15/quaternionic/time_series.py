        angular velocity as

            ω = 2 * dQ/dt * Q⁻¹

        This agress with the standard definition when `Q` is a unit quaternion
        and we rotate a vector `v` according to

            v' = Q * v * Q̄ = Q * v * Q⁻¹,

        in which case ω is a "pure vector" quaternion, and we have the usual

        It also generalizes this to the case where `Q` is not a unit
        quaternion, which means that it also rescales the vector by the amount
        Q*Q̄.  In this case, ω also has a scalar component encoding twice the
        logarithmic time-derivative of this rescaling, and we have

        The output of this function is a frame that rotates the z axis onto the
        same z' axis as the input frame, but with minimal rotation about that
        axis.  This is done by pre-composing the input rotation with a rotation
        about the z axis through an angle γ, where

            dγ/dt = 2*(dR/dt * z * R̄).w

        This ensures that the angular velocity has no component along the z'
        axis.

        Note that this condition becomes easier to impose the closer the input
        rotation is to a minimally rotating frame, which means that repeated
        application of this function improves its accuracy.  By default, this
        function is iterated twice, though a few more iterations may be called
