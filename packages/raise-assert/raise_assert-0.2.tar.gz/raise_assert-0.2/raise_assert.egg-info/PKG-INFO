Description: # raise_assert
        
        A short way to check for conditions and raise if it fails, in Python.
        
        ## Motivation
        
        I get annoyed to need writing all the time variations around:
        
        ```python
        if not isinstance(my_bool, bool):
            raise ValueError("my_bool should be a bool")
        ```
        
        And as pointed several places on the net, ```assert``` cannot really be trusted for performing this sort of checks, as asserts can be disabled with the ```-O``` flag, see for example: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1273211/disable-assertions-in-python .
        
        ## Solution
        
        The raise_assert package contains a single function that allows writing:
        
        ```python
        from raise_assert import ras
        
        ras(isinstance(my_bool, bool))
        ```
        
        or, if you want an error message (but this is usually not needed, as the stack trace is usually explicit enough):
        
        ```python
        from raise_assert import ras
        
        ras(isinstance(my_bool, bool), "my_bool must be a bool")
        ```
        
        ## Installation
        
        ```pip install raise_assert```
        
        ## Why ras?
        
        The word ```ras``` is shortland for both raise_assert and 'rien à signaler', 'nothing to signal' in French.
