ðŸ¤– robots.txt Tester for Large Scale Testing
============================================

Even though they are tiny in size, robots.txt files contain potent information
that can block major sections of your site, which is what they are supposed to
do. Only sometimes you might make the mistake of blocking the wrong section.

So it is very important to check if certain pages (or groups of pages) are
blocked for a certain user-agent by a certain robots.txt file. Ideally, you
would want to run the same check for all possible user-agents. Even more
ideally, you want to be able to run the check for a large number of pages with
every possible combination with user-agents!

To get the robots.txt file into an easily readable format, you can use the
:func:`robotstxt_to_df` function to get it in a DataFrame.

[282 rows x 4 columns]


The returned DataFrame contains columns for directives, their content, the URL
of the robots.txt file, as well as the date it was downloaded.
Under the `directive` column you can see the main commands; Allow, Disallow,
Sitemap, Crawl-delay, User-agent, and so on. The `content` column contains the
details of each of those directives (the pattern to disallow, the sitemap URL,
etc.)

As for testing, the :func:`robotstxt_test` function runs a test for a given
robots.txt file, checking which of the provided user-agents can fetch which of
the provided URLs, paths, or patterns.

>>> robotstxt_test('https://www.example.com/robots.txt',
...                useragents=['Googlebot', 'baiduspider', 'Bingbot']
...                urls=['/', '/hello', '/some-page.html']])

As a result, you get a DataFrame with a row for each combination of
(user-agent, URL) indicating whether or not that particular user-agent can
fetch the given URL.

Some reasons why you might want to do that:

* SEO Audits: Especially for large websites with many URL patterns, and many
  rules for different user-agents.
* Developer or site owner about to make large changes
* Interest in strategies of certain companies

User-agents
-----------

In reality there are only two groups of user-agents that you need to worry
about:

* User-agents listed in the robots.txt file: For each one of those you need to
  check whether or not they are blocked from fetching a certain URL
  (or pattern).
* ``*`` all other user-agents: The ``*`` includes all other user-agents, so
  checking the rules that apply to it should take care of the rest.

robots.txt Testing Approach
---------------------------

1. Get the robots.txt file that you are interested in
2. Extract the user-agents from it
3. Specify the URLs you are interested in testing
4. Run the :func:`robotstxt_test` function

[466 rows x 4 columns]

Now that we have downloaded the file, we can easily extract the list of
user-agents that it contains.

>>> fb_useragents = (fb_robots
...                  [fb_robots['directive']=='User-agent']
...                  ['content'].drop_duplicates()
...                  .tolist())
>>> fb_useragents
['Applebot',
 'baiduspider',
 'Bingbot',
 'Discordbot',
 'facebookexternalhit',
 'Googlebot',
 'Googlebot-Image',
 'ia_archiver',
 'LinkedInBot',
 'msnbot',
 'Naverbot',
 'Pinterestbot',
 'seznambot',
 'Slurp',
 'teoma',
 'TelegramBot',
 'Twitterbot',
 'Yandex',
 'Yeti',
 '*']


Quite a long list!

As a small and quick test, I'm interested in checking the home page, a random
profile page (/bbc), groups and hashtags pages.

>>> urls_to_test = ['/', '/bbc', '/groups', '/hashtag/']
>>> fb_test = robotstxt_test('https://www.facebook.com/robots.txt',
...                          fb_useragents, urls_to_test)
>>> fb_test
                          robotstxt_url user_agent   url_path  can_fetch
0   https://www.facebook.com/robots.txt          *       /bbc      False

3   https://www.facebook.com/robots.txt          *  /hashtag/      False
4   https://www.facebook.com/robots.txt   Applebot          /       True

75  https://www.facebook.com/robots.txt  seznambot    /groups       True

For twenty user-agents and four URLs each, we received a total of eighty test
results. You can immediately see that all user-agents not listed (denoted by
`*` are not allowed to fetch any of the provided URLs).

Let's see who is and who is not allowed to fetch the home page.

>>> fb_test.query('url_path== "/"')
                          robotstxt_url           user_agent  url_path  can_fetch

76  https://www.facebook.com/robots.txt                teoma         /       True

I'll leave it to you to figure out why LinkedIn and Pinterest are not allowed
to crawl the home page but Google and Apple are, because I have no clue!
