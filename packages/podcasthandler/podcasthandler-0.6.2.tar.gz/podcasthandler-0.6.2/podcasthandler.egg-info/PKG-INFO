Description: # Podcast Handler
        
        A simple tool to play and keep track of your podcasts.
        
        It consist in a simple command-line script and a simple ncurses gui to listen to your podcasts in streaming, without downloading them.
        
        It saves the current elapsed time, so you can stop listening and than continue later restarting from the correct position.
        
        You can manually insert the url of the audio file in the command line, or set it as the default player in your favourite podcast aggregator (I use [newsboat](https://newsboat.org/), more info above)
        
        ## Requirements
        
        1. Python >= 3.0 
        2. Music Player Daemon ([link](https://www.musicpd.org/))
        
        ## Install
        
        To install the package use the python package installer pip:
        
        ```
        $ pip install podcasthandler
        ```
        
        Please note that the music server [mpd](https://www.musicpd.org/) should be running in your computer, in order to use the program.
        
        You can also download the [source code](https://gitlab.com/fnt400/podcasthandler) from GitLab:
        
        ```
        $ git clone https://gitlab.com/fnt400/podcasthandler.git
        ```
        
        
        ## Usage
        
        
        Here's the help file:
        
        ```
        usage: podcasthandler [-h] [-H HOST] [-u URL] [-p POSITION] [-g] command
        
        positional arguments:
          command               play, stop, status, restart, gui, version
        
        optional arguments:
          -h, --help            show this help message and exit
          -H HOST, --host HOST  set mpd host (default localhost)
          -u URL, --url URL     set podcast episode url
          -p POSITION, --position POSITION
                                set podcast position (mm:ss)
          -g, --gui             start with curses gui
        ```
        
        And here's the available commands:
        
        ### Play
        
        Play a specified url. Without the URL argument, it continues the last played url.
        
        With the POSITION argument, it starts playing from a specific position (minutes:seconds)
        
        You can set the mpd host (if you have other mpd instances in your local network), the next time, if not specified, it will use the same host.
        
        Examples:
        
        ```
        $ podcasthandler play
        ```
        With this command it will continue playing the last file you listened to, from the correct position in the last mpd server you used (probably your own computer, so "localhost").
        
        ```
        $ podcasthandler play -u "https://www.buzzsprout.com/1263722/5071877-unfettered-freedom-ep-3-facebook-zoom-appimage-kdenlive-new-linux-users.mp3?blob_id=20355212" -H 192.168.1.50 -p 5:24
        ```
        
        With this command it will start playing that audio file address in the computer at 192.168.1.50 from 5 minutes and 24 seconds.
        
        
        ### Stop
        
        Stop playing.
        
        ### Status
        
        It displays generic information about what you are listening to or what you listened the last time.
        
        ### Restart
        
        Restart from the beginning of the file.
        
        ### Gui
        
        Start the ncurses gui.
        
        ### Version
        
        Print version and exit.
        
        # Podcast aggregator
        
        Podcasthandler can be used as stand alone audio player manually inserting the correct audio file url. However, it could be simpler to use a podcast aggregator! 
        
        You can set it as the default audio player using the ncurses gui.
        Please note that ncurses is a terminal interface, so if you are using a graphical software, you should always start the program in a terminal window, with a command like that:
        
        ```
        $ xterm -e podcasthandler play -g -H localhost -u
        ```
        
        ### Newsboat
        
        If your are using Newsboat, you can add this line to the config file (usually in ~/.config/newsboat/config):
        
        ```
        browser "podcasthandler play -g -H localhost -u %u"
        ```
        
        You can select the playable file within the article, pushing the key "1".
