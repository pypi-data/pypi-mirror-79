def shortest_simple_paths(G, source, target, weight=None, ignore_nodes=None,

    """Generate all simple paths in the graph G from source to target,
       starting from shortest ones.

    A simple path is a path with no repeated nodes.

    If a weighted shortest path search is to be used, no negative weights
    are allowed.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph

    source : node
       Starting node for path

    target : node
       Ending node for path

    weight : string
        Name of the edge attribute to be used as a weight. If None all
        edges are considered to have unit weight. Default value None.

    ignore_nodes : container of nodes
       nodes to ignore, optional

    ignore_edges : container of edges
       edges to ignore, optional

    Returns
    -------
    path_generator: generator
       A generator that produces lists of simple paths, in order from
       shortest to longest.

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXNoPath
       If no path exists between source and target.

    NetworkXError
       If source or target nodes are not in the input graph.

    NetworkXNotImplemented
       If the input graph is a Multi[Di]Graph.

    Examples
    --------

    >>> G = nx.cycle_graph(7)
    >>> paths = list(nx.shortest_simple_paths(G, 0, 3))
    >>> print(paths)
    [[0, 1, 2, 3], [0, 6, 5, 4, 3]]

    You can use this function to efficiently compute the k shortest/best
    paths between two nodes.

    >>> from itertools import islice
    >>> def k_shortest_paths(G, source, target, k, weight=None):
    ...     return list(islice(nx.shortest_simple_paths(G, source, target,
    ...         weight=weight), k))
    >>> for path in k_shortest_paths(G, 0, 3, 2):
    ...     print(path)
    [0, 1, 2, 3]
    [0, 6, 5, 4, 3]

    Notes
    -----
    This procedure is based on algorithm by Jin Y. Yen [1]_.  Finding
    the first $K$ paths requires $O(KN^3)$ operations.
