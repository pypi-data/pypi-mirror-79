    """Run Adeft disambiguation on an Agent in a given Statement.

    This function looks at the evidence of the given Statement and attempts
    to look up the full paper or the abstract for the evidence. If both of
    those fail, the evidence sentence itself is used for disambiguation.
    The disambiguation model corresponding to the Agent text is then called,
    and the highest scoring returned grounding is set as the Agent's new
    grounding.

    The Statement's annotations as well as the Agent are modified in place
    and no value is returned.

    Parameters
    ----------
    stmt : indra.statements.Statement
        An INDRA Statement in which the Agent to be disambiguated appears.
    agent : indra.statements.Agent
        The Agent (potentially grounding mapped) which we want to
        disambiguate in the context of the evidence of the given Statement.
    idx : int
        The index of the new Agent's position in the Statement's agent list
        (needed to set annotations correctly).

    Returns
    -------
    bool
        True if disambiguation was successfully applied, and False otherwise.
        Reasons for a False response can be the lack of evidence as well as
        failure to obtain text for grounding disambiguation.
