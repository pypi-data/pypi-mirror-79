Description: #Auto-Chomsky phrase generator
        
        Chomsky sentence generator.
        
        Chomsky is an aid to writing linguistic papers in the style
        of the great master.  It is based on selected phrases taken
        from actual books and articles written by Noam Chomsky.
        Upon request, it assembles the phrases in the elegant
        stylistic patterns that Chomsky is noted for.
        
        To generate sentences of linguistic wisdom in a paragraph
        
        For 1 sentence wrapped at 72 characters:
        
        > chomsky()
        
        For n sentences wrapped at 72 characters:
        
        > chomsky(n)
        
        For n sentence wrapped at x characters:
        
        > chomsky(n, x)
        
        The phrase database was converted directly from someone else's Lisp program:
