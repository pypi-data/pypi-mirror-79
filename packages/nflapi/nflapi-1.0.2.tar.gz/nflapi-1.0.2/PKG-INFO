        ## Notice Regarding API Token
        This API wrapper does not facilitate obtaining 
        an access token, which is required to submit requests to the NFL API. The 
        author of this API wrapper is not aware of any documented method to obtain 
        an access token, and will not assist with this. If you do not have a valid 
        method of obtaining an access token, this API wrapper will be useless.
        
        ## Copyright Notice
        The author of this API wrapper is not affiliated with NFL. This API wrapper 
        does not contain any NFL data, and the use of NFL data is subject to NFL copyright 
        restrictions.
