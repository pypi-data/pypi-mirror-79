    """Converts a pytket Circuit object to a :class:`jaqalpaq.core.Circuit`.
    The circuit will be structured as a sequence of parallel blocks, one for each Cirq
    Moment in the input. The circuit will be structured into a sequence of unscheduled
    blocks. All instructions between one barrier statement and the next will be put into
    an unscheduled block together. If the :mod:`jaqalpaq.scheduler` is run on the circuit,
    as many as possible of those gates will be parallelized within each block, while
    maintaining the order of the blocks. Otherwise, the circuit will be treated as a fully
    sequential circuit.

    Measurement commands are supported, but only if applied to every qubit in the circuit
    in immediate succession. If so, they will be mapped to a measure_all gate. If the
    circuit does not end with a measurement, then a measure_all gate will be appended to
    it.

    Circuits containing multiple quantum registers will be converted to circuits with a
    single quantum register, containing all the qubits from each register. The parts of
    that larger register that correspond to each of the original registers will be mapped
    with the appropriate names. Circuits containing multiple-index qubits will have each
    such qubit mapped to a single-qubit register named with the indices separated by
    underscore characters.

    Measurements are supported, but only if applied to every qubit in the circuit in the
    same moment. If so, they will be mapped to a measure_all gate. If the measure_all gate
    is not the last gate in the circuit, a prepare_all gate will be inserted after it.
    Additionally, a prepare_all gate will be inserted before the first moment. If the
    circuit does not end with a measurement, then a measure_all gate will be appended.

    :param pytket.circuit.Circuit tkc: The Circuit to convert.
    :param names: A mapping from pytket OpTypes to functions taking qubits and gate
    angle parameters and returning a tuple of arguments for
        :meth:`jaqalpaq.core.Circuit.build_gate`. If omitted, maps
        ``pytket.OpType.PhasedX`` to the QSCOUT ``R`` gate, ``pytket.OpType.Rz`` to the
        QSCOUT ``Rz`` gate, and ``pytket.OpType.XXPhase`` to the QSCOUT ``MS`` gate. The
        ``pytket.passes.SynthesizeUMD`` compilation pass will compile a circuit into this
        basis.
    :type names: dict or None
    :param native_gates: The native gate set to target. If None, target the QSCOUT native
        gates.
    :type native_gates: dict or None
    :returns: The same quantum circuit, converted to JaqalPaq.
