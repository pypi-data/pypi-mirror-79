******************
Nengo Sphinx Theme
******************

This repository contains a Sphinx theme
for documentation of Nengo projects.
It is closely tied to the `Nengo website repository
<https://github.com/nengo/nengo.github.io>`_
both in look-and-feel and in code organization.
Most static assets,
including the CSS files needed for this theme,
are part of the Nengo website repository
in order to minimize duplication.
Development therefore happens across both repositories.
We also discourage the use of this theme
by any projects not hosted under the https://www.nengo.ai domain.

Props
=====

The initial design of this theme was done in 2019
by a team at `Fusionbox <https://www.fusionbox.com/>`_,
who were lovely to work with.
