Description: bfg9000 - build file generator
        ==============================
        
        **bfg9000** is a cross-platform *build configuration system* with an
        emphasis on making it easy to define how to build your software. It
        converts a Python-based build script into the appropriate files for your
        underlying build system of choice (Ninja, Make, or MSBuild).
        
        Why bfg9000?
        ------------
        
        Familiar syntax
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        ``build.bfg`` files are just Python scripts with some new functions
        added, so you may already know how to write them; and when your build
        gets complicated, you can rely on the existing Python ecosystem to get
        you out of trouble.
        
        Fast builds
        ^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        bfg9000 ensures your builds are fast by relying on existing, mature
        build systems like Make and Ninja to do the heavy lifting of building
        your software; often, incremental builds don’t need to execute bfg9000
        at all!
        
        Stay sane
        ^^^^^^^^^
        
        Building your code shouldn’t be the hard part of developing your
        project. Above all else, bfg9000 strives to help you get your build
        right the *first* time with many helpful
        `features <https://jimporter.github.io/bfg9000/latest/user/features>`__.
        
        A brief example
        ---------------
        
        You can’t get much simpler than the simplest ``build.bfg`` file:
        
        .. code:: python
        
           executable('simple', files=['simple.cpp'])
        
        To build this executable, we need to create the actual build files and
        then run them:
        
        .. code:: sh
        
           $ cd /path/to/src/
           $ 9k build/
           $ cd build/
           $ ninja
        
        From there, you can run your newly-created executable: ``./simple``.
        Hooray!
        
        For further examples, please see the
        ```examples/`` <https://github.com/jimporter/bfg9000/tree/master/examples>`__
        subdirectory.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        bfg9000 uses `setuptools <https://pythonhosted.org/setuptools/>`__, so
        installation is much the same as any other Python package:
        
        .. code:: sh
        
           $ pip install bfg9000
        
        From there, you can start using bfg to build your software! (If you’re
        using Ubuntu, you can also install bfg9000 from the following PPA:
        `ppa:jimporter/stable <https://launchpad.net/~jimporter/+archive/ubuntu/stable>`__).
        For more information about how to install bfg9000, see the
        `documentation <https://jimporter.github.io/bfg9000/latest/getting-started>`__.
