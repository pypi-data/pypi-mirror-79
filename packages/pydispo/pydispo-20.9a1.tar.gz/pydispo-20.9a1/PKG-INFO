        `pydispo` is a pure-pythonic way of managing disposable mailbox that allows users to create several disposable email addresses and receive emails on those. It can be directly used from the command line or imported as a python module for advanced usage. `pydispo` is platform-independent and uses python standard libraries, so if you have python installed you don't need to satisfy any additional dependencies. Currently, it uses 1secmail API to receive emails, and soon it would support some other APIs.  If you are interested in a bash-like implementation with some dependencies, please check the [tmpmail](https://github.com/sdushantha/tmpmail) script. 
        
        Optionally, `pydispo` can fetch attached files and there's also a provision to save emails as HTML.  By default, the emails are shown as text, optionally any standard web browser can be used to view the emails.

        ## Why disposable emails?
        To avoid SPAM. To protect your PRIVACY.  Lots of web pages, blogs, forums and services would ask you to register or provide email addresses to read comments, download content, or register account or profile. And a lot of them will use your private email address to send you spam. Disposable emails are perfect for any transaction where you want to improve your online privacy, like when you trade cryptocurrencies. These are also used by developers and testers for several time-saving reasons.

        ## Credits 
        `pydispo` is a dependency-free, platform-independent replication of Siddharth's [tmpmail](https://github.com/sdushantha/tmpmail) bash-script and follows a usage pattern similar to it.
