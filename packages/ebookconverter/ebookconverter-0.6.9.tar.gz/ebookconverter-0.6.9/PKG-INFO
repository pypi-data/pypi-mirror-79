Description: # ebookconverter
        code that orchestrates ebook conversion for project gutenberg
        
        
        EbookConverter manages the creation and update of ebook assets for Project Gutenberg. It uses a postgres database to keep track of both ebook metadata and ebook files. the postgress database is managed by the libgutenberg package.
        
        The cron-rebuild-files.sh script runs as a cron job, rebuilding 2100 books per day, so as to rebuild every book roughly once a month.
        
        ebookconverter talks to the gutenberg database to build a list of ebookmaker jobs. These jobs require some metadata about the book, and a target file to process.
        
        ebookconverter expects source files to be in numbered directories in a 'files' directory. The location of the files directory is given by the FILESDIR config parameter.
        
        Config parameters should be set in a file at /etc/ebookconverter.conf or ~/.ebookconverter
        
        ebookconverter has been tested on Python 3.6.7. It's not expected to run on python 2.7
