        ###### Current version: 1.2.7
        ## TL;DR
        [TL;DR]: #tldr
        - This is **not** replacing the SiemplifySDK but a module which extends it.
        - This is either _overriding_ or _adding_ a few methods or classes to be used with Siemplify.
        - You are not obliged to choose between the SiemplifySDK and RSM, just use what you need. (Just don't get confused.)
        
        ## Compatibility
        [Compatibility]: #compatibility
        This module supports Python _>=_ 3.7 and was tested with Siemplify _v5.5.1.X_
        
        ## About
        [About]: #about
        After spending most of my days configuring, implementing Siemplify, a SOAR(Security Orchestration, Automation and Response) platform over the last months.
        I decided to build something that would improve productivity as most of my time was spent in troubleshooting with problems that a customer should not encounter.
        
        ### Why did you name this repo 'realsiemplify' if it isn't an Official repository from Siemplify?
        This name was chosen to be as ironic as possible since _Siemplify_ is pronounced the same way as _Simplify_ and I do no consider this to be simple since it can be really confusing to work on something with the SiemplifySDK.
        You know the way little repetitive things that bothers you? I'm sure you've experienced something in your life that made those little things turn into something heavy, well, I feel you.
        
        ### Do you still recommend Siemplify?
        I **absolutely** do recommend it.
        
        Every products has their pros and cons.
        
        Here is what I value the most and to me, it really is making the difference:
        ### Relationship
        - Siemplify has an **incredible** support team.
        - Transparency is key with their relationship with customers.
        - They are open to any feedback and they will be there for you if you need them.
        
        ### Are you against Siemplify?
        Not at all. Siemplify has significantly improved since I first started using the product and they keep evolving very quickly.
        
        My lack of patience is mostly what caused all of this.
