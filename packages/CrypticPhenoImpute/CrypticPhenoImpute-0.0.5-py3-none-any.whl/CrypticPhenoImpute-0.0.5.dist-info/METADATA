# CrypticPhenoImpute

This software imputes the cryptic phenotypes inferred in Blair et al. 2020 into arbitrary ICD10-CM/ICD10-UKBB datasets. It is for replication purposes only, and it will not perform de novo model inference. Note, model files are not distributed with the package and must be downloaded on the fly from GitHub. Therefore, imputation may take several minutes as files are downloaded prior to utilization.

# Installation

pip install CrypticPhenoImpute

# Use

This software is intended to be used from the command line. Please type 'python -m CrypticPhenoImpute -h' into the command line following installation for instructions.
