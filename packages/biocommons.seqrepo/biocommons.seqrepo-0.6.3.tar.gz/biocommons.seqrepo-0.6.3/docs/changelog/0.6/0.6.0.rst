0.6.0 (2020-07-05)
###################

Changes since 0.5.6 (2020-04-12).

Special Attention
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

The major change in this release is the addition of compatibility code
to ease the transition to namespaces based on CURIE prefixes used at
identifiers.org.  The 0.5 series added the ability to use `refseq` as
a synonym for `NCBI`; this 0.6 series provides similar and more robust
support for NCBI/refseq, Ensembl/ensembl, LRG/lrg, and
VMC/ga4gh/sha512t24u digests; 0.7 will drop backward support for
`NCBI`, `Ensembl`, and `LRG` (but preserve case-squashed variations
found in identfiers.org).  See: `#31 <https://github.com/biocommons/biocommons.seqrepo/issues/31/>`_, `#80 <https://github.com/biocommons/biocommons.seqrepo/issues/80/>`_, `#62 <https://github.com/biocommons/biocommons.seqrepo/issues/62/>`_.
