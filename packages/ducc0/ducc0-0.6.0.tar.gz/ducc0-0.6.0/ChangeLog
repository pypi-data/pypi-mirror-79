0.6.0:
- general:
  - multi-threading improvements contributed by Peter Bell
- wgridder:
  - new, smaller internal data structure


0.5.0:
- wgridder:
  - internally used grid size is now chosen automatically, and the parameters
    "nu" and "nv" are ignored; they will be removed in ducc1.


0.3.0:
- general:
  - The package should now be installable from PyPI via pip even on MacOS.
    However, MacOS >= 10.14 is required.

- wgridder:
  - very substantial performance and scaling improvements


0.2.0:

- wgridder:
  - kernels are now evaluated via polynomial approximation, allowing much
    more freedom in the choice of kernel function
  - switch to 2-parameter ES kernels for better accuracy
  - unnecessary FFT calculations are skipped

- totalconvolve:
  - improved accuracy by making use of the new wgridder kernels
  - *INTERFACE CHANGE* removed method "epsilon_guess()"

- pointingprovider:
  new, experimental module for computing detector pointings from a time stream
  of satellite pointings. To be used by litebird_sim initially.
