        BOML is a modularized optimization library that unifies several ML algorithms into a common bilevel optimization framework. It provides interfaces to implement popular bilevel optimization algorithms, so that you could quickly build your own meta learning neural network and test its performance.
        
        **Key features of BOML**
        
        - **Unified bilevel optimization framework** to address different categories of existing meta-learning paradigms. 
        - **Modularized algorithmic structure** to integrate a variety of optimization techniques and popular methods.
        - **Unit tests with Travis CI and Codecov** to reach 99% coverage, and following **PEP8 naming convention** to guarantee the code quality. 
        - **Comprehensive documentations** using sphinx and **flexible functional interfaces** similar to conventional optimizers to help researchers quickly get familiar with the procedures.
