Installation Instructions
=========================

The easyiest way to install MailingLogger is::

  easy_install mailinglogger

Or, if you're using `zc.buildout`, just specify ``mailinglogger`` as a
required egg. 

.. topic:: Python version requirements

  This package requires Python 2.0 or above.

  Due to a bug in Python 2.5.0,
  :class:`~mailinglogger.SummarisingLogger` requires a 
  any version of Python with the logging framework present
  *other* than 2.5.0.

  When installing with a version of Python lower than 2.6, you may see
  compilation errors. These can safely be ignored.
