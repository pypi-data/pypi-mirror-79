### BACKUP: Export the whole configuration of objects into a single JSON

```bash
$ solconfig backup --help
Usage: solconfig backup [OPTIONS] [vpn|cluster|ca] OBJECT_NAMES

  Export the whole configuration of objects into a single JSON

  OBJECT_NAMES is a comma-separated list of names, like "vpn01" or
  "vpn01,vpn02", or "*" means all.

Options:
  --reserve-default-value     Reserve the attributes with default value, by
                              default they are removed to make the result JSON

                              Before version 9.6.x (sempVersion 2.17), there
                              is no way to get the value of "write-only"
                              attributes like the password of Client
                              Usernames, so that the backup output is not 100
                              percent as same as the configuration on the PS+
                              broker. Means you need to set those "write-only"
                              attributes manually after your restore the
                              configuration.

                              Since version 9.6.x (sempVersion 2.17), with a
                              password is provided in the opaquePassword query
                              parameter, attributes with the opaque property
                              (like the password of Client Usernames) are
                              retrieved in a GET in opaque form, encrypted
                              with this password.

                              The backup output is now 100 percent as same as
                              the configuration on the PS+ broker, and the
                              same  opaquePassword is used to restore the
                              configuration.

                              The opaquePassword is only supported over HTTPS,
                              and must be between 8 and 128 characters
                              inclusive!

  --help                      Show this message and exit.
```

solconfig update --help
Usage: solconfig update [OPTIONS] CONFIG_FILE

  configuration file.

  This "update" command is a good complement to "create" command, especially

  since you can only update them.
