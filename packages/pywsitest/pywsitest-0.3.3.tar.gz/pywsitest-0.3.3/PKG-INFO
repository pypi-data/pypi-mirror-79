        # pywsitest
        ## PYthon WebSocket Integration TESTing framework
        
        A python API to assist with automated websocket integration testing
        
        ## Installation
        ```
        pip install pywsitest
        ```
        
        ## Package contents
        ### [WSTest](https://github.com/gridsmartercities/pywsitest/blob/master/pywsitest/ws_test.py)
        WSTest is the main test running class in pywsitest. It currently has the following methods:
        - **with_parameter**: add a query parameter to the connection
        - **with_header**: add a header to the connection
        - **with_response**: add an expected response to the test runner
        - **with_message**: add a message for the test runner to send on connection
        - **with_request**: attach a rest api request to the instance of this class
        - **with_response_timeout**: set the timeout in seconds for the test runner to wait for a response from the websocket
        - **with_message_timeout**: set the timeout in seconds for the test runner to wait while trying to send a message to the websocket
        - **with_request_timeout**: set the timeout in seconds for the rest request attached to the instance of this class
        - **with_test_timeout**: set the timeout in seconds for the test runner to run for
        - **with_received_response_logging**: enable logging of received responses on response timeout error
        - **run**: asyncronously run the test runner, sending all messages and listening for responses
        - **is_complete**: check whether all expected responses have been received and messages have been sent
        
        ### [WSResponse](https://github.com/gridsmartercities/pywsitest/blob/master/pywsitest/ws_response.py)
        WSResponse is a class to represent an expected response from the websocket
        - **with_attribute**: add an attribute to check an incoming response against
        - **with_trigger**: add a message to trigger when a response matching this instance has been received
        - **is_match**: check whether a received response matches the attributes of this instance
        
        ### [WSMessage](https://github.com/gridsmartercities/pywsitest/blob/master/pywsitest/ws_message.py)
        WSMessage is a class to represent a message to send to the websocket
        - **with_attribute**: add an attribute to the message to be sent to the websocket host
        - **with_delay**: add a delay to the message to be sent to the websocket host
        
        ### [RestRequest](https://github.com/gridsmartercities/pywsitest/blob/master/pywsitest/rest_request.py)
        RestRequest is a class to represent a request to send to rest api
        - **with_header**: add a header to the request to be sent to the rest api
        - **with_body**: add a body to the request to be sent to the rest api
        - **with_delay**: add a delay to the request to be sent to the rest api
        
        ## Examples
        
        ### Response testing
        Testing a response with a body is received on connection to a websocket host:
        ```py
        from pywsitest import WSTest, WSResponse
        
        ws_test = (
            WSTest("wss://example.com")
            .with_response(
                WSResponse()
                .with_attribute("body")
            )
        )
        
        await ws_test.run()
        
        assert ws_test.is_complete()
        ```
        
        Testing that a response with the following more complicated body is received on connection to a websocket host:
        ```json
        {
            "body": {
                "attribute": "value"
            }
        }
        ```
        
        ```py
        from pywsitest import WSTest, WSResponse
        
        ws_test = (
            WSTest("wss://example.com")
            .with_response(
                WSResponse()
                .with_attribute("body")
                .with_attribute("body/attribute", "value")
            )
        )
        
        await ws_test.run()
        
        assert ws_test.is_complete()
        ```
        
        Testing that a response with the following body with a list is received on connection to a websocket host:
        ```json
        {
            "body": [
                {"colour": "red"},
                {"colour": "green"},
                {"colour": "blue"}
            ]
        }
        ```
        
        ```py
        from pywsitest import WSTest, WSResponse
        
        ws_test = (
            WSTest("wss://example.com")
            .with_response(
                WSResponse()
                .with_attribute("body/0/colour", "red")
                .with_attribute("body/1/colour", "green")
                .with_attribute("body/2/colour", "blue")
            )
        )
        
        await ws_test.run()
        
        assert ws_test.is_complete()
        ```
        
        Testing that a response with the following body with a list containing the colour `green` somewhere is received on connection to a websocket host:
        ```json
        {
            "body": [
                {"colour": "red"},
                {"colour": "green"},
                {"colour": "blue"}
            ]
        }
        ```
        
        ```py
        from pywsitest import WSTest, WSResponse
        
        ws_test = (
            WSTest("wss://example.com")
            .with_response(
                WSResponse()
                .with_attribute("body//colour", "green")
            )
        )
        
        await ws_test.run()
        
        assert ws_test.is_complete()
        ```
        
        ### Message sending
        Sending a message on connection to a websocket host:
        ```py
        from pywsitest import WSTest, WSMessage
        
        ws_test = (
            WSTest("wss://example.com")
            .with_message(
                WSMessage()
                .with_attribute("body", "Hello, world!")
            )
        )
        
        await ws_test.run()
        
        assert ws_test.is_complete()
        ```
        
        Triggering a message to be sent with extracted data when the following response is received:
        ```json
        {
            "body": {
                "message": "Hello, world!"
            }
        }
        ```
        
        ```py
        from pywsitest import WSTest, WSResponse, WSMessage
        
        ws_test = (
            WSTest("wss://example.com")
            .with_response(
                WSResponse()
                .with_attribute("body/message")
                .with_trigger(
                    WSMessage()
                    .with_attribute("body", "${body/message}")
                )
            )
        )
        
        await ws_test.run()
        
        assert ws_test.is_complete()
        ```
        
        Triggering a message to be sent with the first colour extracted from a list when the following response is received:
        ```json
        {
            "body": [
                {"colour": "red"},
                {"colour": "green"},
                {"colour": "blue"}
            ]
        }
        ```
        
        ```py
        from pywsitest import WSTest, WSResponse, WSMessage
        
        ws_test = (
            WSTest("wss://example.com")
            .with_response(
                WSResponse()
                .with_attribute("body/0/colour")
                .with_trigger(
                    WSMessage()
                    .with_attribute("body", "${body/0/colour}")
                )
            )
        )
        
        await ws_test.run()
        
        assert ws_test.is_complete()
        ```
        
        ### Using rest requests
        Attaching simple rest get request and sending it:
        ```py
        rest_request = (
            RestRequest("https://example.com", "GET")
            .with_body({"some_key": some_value})
        )
        
        ws_test = (
            WSTest("wss://example.com")
            .with_request(rest_request)
        )
        
        await ws_test.run()
        
        for response in ws_tester.received_request_responses:
            print(response.status_code)
            print(response.json())
        
        assert ws_test.is_complete()
        ```
        
        ### Error handling
        Force a test to fail is execution takes more than 30 seconds (default 60 seconds)
        ```py
        ws_test = (
            WSTest("wss://example.com")
            .with_test_timeout(30)
            .with_response(
                WSResponse()
                .with_attribute("body")
            )
        )
        
        await ws_test.run()
        
        assert ws_test.is_complete()
        ```
        
        Force a test to fail if no response is received for 15 seconds (default 10 seconds) 
        - Any responses that haven't been sent will be output along with the `WSTimeoutError`
        - Received responses can be output too by calling `with_received_response_logging` on the `WSTest` instance
        ```py
        ws_test = (
            WSTest("wss://example.com")
            .with_response_timeout(15)
            .with_received_response_logging()
            .with_response(
                WSResponse()
                .with_attribute("body")
            )
        )
        
        await ws_test.run()
        
        assert ws_test.is_complete()
        ```
        
        Force a test to fail is a message takes longer than 15 seconds to send (default 10 seconds)
        - The message that the test runner failed to send will be output along with the `WSTimeoutError`
        ```py
        ws_test = (
            WSTest("wss://example.com")
            .with_message_timeout(15)
            .with_message(
                WSMessage()
                .with_attribute("body", "Hello, world!")
            )
        )
        
        await ws_test.run()
        
        assert ws_test.is_complete()
        ```
