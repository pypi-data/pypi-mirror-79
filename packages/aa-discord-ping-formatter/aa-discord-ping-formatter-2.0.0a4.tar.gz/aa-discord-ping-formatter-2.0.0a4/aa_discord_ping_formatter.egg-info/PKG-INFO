        ## Installation
        
        **Important**: This app is a plugin for Alliance Auth. If you don't have Alliance Auth running already, please install it first before proceeding. (see the official [AA installation guide](https://allianceauth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/allianceauth.html) for details)
        
        ### Step 1 - Install app
        
        Make sure you are in the virtual environment (venv) of your Alliance Auth installation. Then install the latest version:
        
        ```bash
        pip install aa-discord-ping-formatter
        ```
        
        ### Step 2 - Update your AA settings
        
        Configure your AA settings (`local.py`) as follows:
        
        - Add `'discordpingformatter',` to `INSTALLED_APPS`
        
        
        ### Step 3 - Finalize the installation
        
        Copy static files and run migrations
        
        ```bash
        python manage.py collectstatic
        ```
        
        ```bash
        python manage.py migrate
        ```
        
        Restart your supervisor services for AA
        
        ### Step 4 - Setup permissions
        
        Now you can setup permissions in Alliance Auth for your users. Add ``discordpingformatter | aa discord ping formatter | Can access this app`` to the states and/or groups you would like to have access.
        
        ## Updating
        
        To update your existing installation of AA Discord Ping Formatter first enable your virtual environment.
        
        Then run the following commands from your AA project directory (the one that contains `manage.py`).
        
        ```bash
        pip install -U aa-discord-ping-formatter
        ```
        
        ```bash
        python manage.py collectstatic
        ```
        
        ```bash
        python manage.py migrate
        ```
        
        Finally restart your AA supervisor services.

        ## Configuration
        
        ### Using Slack instead of Discord?
        
        Don't worrie, I don't judge and you still can use this module. It supports also pings to Slack. Simply add the following to your `local.py`. 
        
        ```python
        ## AA Fleet Ping Formatter
        AA_FLEETPINGFORMATTER_USE_SLACK = True
        ```
        
        Although you cannot use your Auth groups as targets for pings with Slack.
