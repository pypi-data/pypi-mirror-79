Description: =========
        pibootctl
        =========
        
        pibootctl is a utility for querying and manipulating the boot configuration of
        a `Raspberry Pi`_. It is a relatively low level utility, and not intended to be
        as friendly (or as widely applicable) as ``raspi-config``. It provides a
        command line interface only, but does attempt to be useful as a basis for more
        advanced interfaces (by providing input and output in human-readable,
        shell-interpretable, JSON, or YAML formats) as well as being useful in its own
        right.
        
        The design philosophy of the utility is as follows:
        
        #. Be safe: the utility manipulates the boot configuration and it's entirely
           possible to create a non-booting system as a result. To that end, if no
           backup of the current boot configuration exists, always take one before
           manipulating it.
        
        #. Be accessible: the Pi's boot configuration lives on a FAT partition and is a
           simple ASCII text file. This means it can be read and manipulated by almost
           any platform (Windows, Mac OS, etc). Any backups of the configuration should
           be as accessible. To that end we use simple PKZIP files to store backups of
           boot configurations (in their original format), and place them on the same
           FAT partition as the configuration.
        
        #. Be extensible: Almost all commands should default to human readable input
           and output, but options should be provided for I/O in JSON, YAML, and a
           shell-parseable format.
