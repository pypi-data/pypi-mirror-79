        Conveniently get a rough idea of how long things take. 
        
        This is a light wrapper around the standard library's [time.monotonic](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.monotonic). 
        
        
        ## How to use:
        
        ## Use via `MagicTimer` object:
        
        ```python
        from magic_timer import MagicTimer
        
        def do_stuff():
            [i*i for i in range(5_000_000)]
        
        timer = MagicTimer()
        do_stuff()
        print('Stuff took', timer)
        ```
        
        ```
        > Stuff took 455 milliseconds
        ```
        
        ## Use via `ftimer` decorator:
        
        ```python
        from magic_timer import ftimer
        
        @ftimer
        def do_stuff():
            [i*i for i in range(20_000_000)]
        
        do_stuff()
        ```
        
        ```
        > `do_stuff` ran in 1.9 seconds.
        ```
        
        #### The use case for this package:
        
        You have something you want to time, but you don't want to time it multiple times with [timeit](https://docs.python.org/3/library/timeit.html).
        
        You also don't want to use [Jupyter's `%%timeit`](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html#magic-timeit) because it puts the cell into a different scope.
        
        You can import `magic-timer`, throw it in, and get a rough idea of the time taken. (It's slightly neater than using time.monotonic directly.)
