upgrade:
  - |
    The `extract_swift_flags.py` script has been removed, and the `autohelp.py`
    and `diff_branches.py` scripts no longer build config file documentation
    for the swift project. The swift dev team had been manually maintaining
    their config files in-tree and to avoid duplication, doc and swift have
    agreed to link the config ref out to the dev docs. As such, there is
    therefore no reason to keep this tooling around.
