upgrade:
  - |
    The `autogenerate_config_docs` set of tools has been removed. These were
    always buggy and hard to maintain, and they have been superseded by the
    ``oslo_config.sphinxext`` `Sphinx extension`__.

  - |
    The ``openstack-auto-commands`` command and its helper script in
    ``bin/doc-tools-update-cli-reference`` have been removed. These have been
    superseded by the ``cliff.sphinxext`` `Sphinx extensions`__.

    __ https://docs.openstack.org/cliff/latest/user/sphinxext.html
  - |
    The following scripts and tools have been removed:

    - prettify.py$
    - remove_trailing_whitespaces.sh$
    - remove_unnecessary_spaces.py$
    - retf$

    These were all indented to cleanup docs once they were already in tree, but
    our tooling and review process should be sufficient to catch most issues
    and there's limited value in submitting whitespace-fixup patches.
