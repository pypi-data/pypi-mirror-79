This file defines entities for equipment. 'Equipment' includes anything
which can be mounted on a ship or carried in its hold.

There are also several non-entity section types that appear in equipment
files. These include Lod, TradeLane, InternalFX, AttachedFX, Explosion,
Light, Motor, LootCrate, Munition and Shield. Currently these are excluded
as they do not exactly fit flint's entity model, and partly for the sake
of simplicity in the first incarnation of equipment parsing.
