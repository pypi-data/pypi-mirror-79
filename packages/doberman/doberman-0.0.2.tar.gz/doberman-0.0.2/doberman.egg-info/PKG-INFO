        # MonitoringAndUpload
        
         A watchdog tool that uploads the modifications of local files to a remote server.
         It is very simple it needs only to have:
        
        - one local directory to be watched
        - one remote directory that you would like to sync with the local one
        - password and ip of the server
        
        
        
        Compatibility:
        
        - MacOs -> natively
        - Linux -> natively
        - WinOs -> we don't like it but if you install Ubuntu subsystem it will hopefully work:)
        
        
        
        [SETUP]
        
        Make a list of the things that you would like to monitor! An example here:
        
        ```python
        import os
        
        def to_watch(dir_path):
        	with open("./files_to_monitor.txt",mode="w") as ff:
        		ff.write("\n".join(arr))
        		
        to_watch(...)
        ```
        
        Does the txt file need to be called "files_to_monitor.txt"? Yes, please.
        
        
        
        [RUN] To run the tool enter the directory of this app with the command:
        
        ```bash
        cd /Users/...fill with the actual path here.../MonitoringAndUpload
        ```
        
        
        
        [RUN] Then type this:
        
        ```bash
        python3 main.py directory_to_watch_path username password server_ip remote_directory
        ```
