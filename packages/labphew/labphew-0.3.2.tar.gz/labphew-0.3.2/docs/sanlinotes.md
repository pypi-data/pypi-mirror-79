## workflow of adapting the code

### from command line


### with gui
- choose user-interface [Aquiles's guide](https://www.pythonforthelab.com/blog/step-by-step-guide-to-building-a-gui/)
- monitor_window.py: for interactive continuous updates
- scan_window.py: to run pre-defined tasks
- config_window.py: to change the measurement configurations


## explain to developers

### terms and elements
- application folder
- Model subfolders

### installaion
- explain python setup.py -develop, makes packages available
- use sys.path.append (folder) as simplest method to add access to the module
