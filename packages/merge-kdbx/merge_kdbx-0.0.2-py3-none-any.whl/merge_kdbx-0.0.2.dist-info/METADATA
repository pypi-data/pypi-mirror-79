# merge_kdbx
# What's this?
This program merges multiple keepass 2.x databases exported in XML. The merged XML includes exclusive entries and last modified ones if two or more sources have an entry with the same title.

# Install

```
pip install merge-kdbx
```

# Usage

```
usage: merge_kdbx.py [-h] [-f FORCE] dst srcs [srcs ...]

positional arguments:
  dst                   path to destination xml files.
  srcs                  paths to source xml file to be merged.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -f FORCE, --force FORCE
                        permit overwriting source file by dst.
```

Then you can import the generated XML into new and empty kdbx database. Existing entries should be removed before import as shown in the below figure.
