Installation
============

Python v2.7 and Orange Canvas v2.7 must imperatively be installed *before* 
Orange Textable. **Please note that Orange Textable is not compatible with
Orange 3 at the time of writing.** After installation, Orange Textable appears in 
the form of an additional tab in Orange Canvas.

The installation procedure is slightly different on Windows and MacOS X. [#]_
