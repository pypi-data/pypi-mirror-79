Beyond a restricted number of sources, substitutions, or regular expressions,
it becomes tedious to configure instances of widgets :ref:`Text Files`,
:ref:`URLs`, :ref:`Recode`, and :ref:`Segment` using their advanced interface.
To alleviate this issue, these widgets enable the user to import or export
manually edited configuration lists in `JSON <http://www.json.org/>`_ format
as described in the following sections.
