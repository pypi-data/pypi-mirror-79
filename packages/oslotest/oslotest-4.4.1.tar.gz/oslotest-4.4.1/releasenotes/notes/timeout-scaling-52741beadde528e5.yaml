features:
  - |
    New class variable, ``TIMEOUT_SCALING_FACTOR`` was added that allows
    modifying a test class to have a longer timeout than other tests in the
    suite without having to raise the default timeout for all tests.
  - |
    New class variable, ``DEFAULT_TIMEOUT`` was added that lets test suite
    authors override the default value of ``OS_TEST_TIMEOUT`` at the
    test suite level.
