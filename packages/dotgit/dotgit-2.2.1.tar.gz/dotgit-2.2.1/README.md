## A comprehensive and versatile dotfiles manager

dotgit will allows you to easily store all your dotfiles for any number of
machines in a single git repository. Written in python with no external
dependencies besides git, it works on both Linux and MacOS (should also work on
other \*nix environments)

## Project goals

* Share files between machines or keep separate versions, all in the same repo
* Make use of an intuitive filelist
* Grouping of files to make organization easy
* Make git source-control convenient and easy to use

## Why use dotgit?

* You can very easily organize and categorize your dotfiles, making it easy to
  store different setups in the same repo (e.g. your workstation and your
  headless server dotfiles, both in the same repo)
* dotgit was designed with its most important goal being to make managing
  multiple machine's dotfiles easy, by allowing to easily share and separate
  dotfiles between machines
* Ease-of-use is baked into everything without hindering more advanced users.
  For instance, dotgit can automatically commit and push commits for you should
  you want it to, but you can just as easily make the commits yourself
* dotgit has an automated test suite that tests its functionality with several
  versions of Python on Linux and MacOS to ensure cross-platform compatibility
* Support for both symlinking or copying dotfiles to your home directory.
  Copying allows you to quickly bootstrap a machine without leaving your repo
  or dotgit on it
* No external dependencies apart from git allowing you to install and use
  dotgit easily in any environment that supports Python
* Encryption using GnuPG supported to allow you to store sensitive dotfiles

## Usage example

An example filelist might look something like this:


```
# grouping makes organization a breeze
laptop=tools,x,ssh
desktop=tools,x

# sharing/splitting of dotfiles between hosts
.vimrc:tools
.vimrc:pi

.xinitrc:x

# encryption support using GnuPG
.ssh/id_rsa:ssh|encrypt
.ssh/id_rsa.pub:ssh|encrypt

.bashrc

# easily group dotfiles for other hosts into your dotgit repo
.foo:server
```

Firstly, there will be two .vimrc files. The first one will be shared between
the hosts `desktop` and `laptop`. There will also be a separate `.vimrc` inside
the dotgit repository that will only be used with the `pi` host.

The second thing to notice is that you can use categories to group dotfiles. In
the example there is a `tools` and `x` category. This makes working with a
group of dotfiles a breeze.

In this example the host `laptop`'s ssh public and private key will also be
stored in the dotgit repo, but it will be safely encrypted using GnuPG
symmetrical encryption.

Since no host was specified with `.bashrc` it will reside inside the `common`
category. This means that it will be shared among all hosts using this dotgit
repository (unless a category is specifically used along with the dotgit
commands).

Lastly the `.foo` will only be used when you explicitly use the category
`server`. This way you can for instance keep your "server" dotfiles in your
main dotfiles repo without cluttering your normal dotgit workflow.

## Installation

Arch Linux users can install the
[AUR package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/dotgit).

If you are not on Arch, the easiest way to install dotgit is using pip
(substitute `pip` with `pip3` if you're on a Debian-like system):

```
pip install dotgit
```

You can also get bash-completion to work by installing dotgit's bash-completion
in your home folder:

```
url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kobus-v-schoor/dotgit/master/pkg/completion/bash.sh"
curl "$url" >> ~/.bash_completion
```

You can also get completion for fish shell by using the following:

```
url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kobus-v-schoor/dotgit/master/pkg/completion/fish.fish
curl --create-dirs "$url" >> ~/.config/fish/completions/dotgit.fish
```

PRs for improvements for the fish shell completion (or for any other shell) are
welcome :grin:

## Getting started

1. Choose a folder where you want to store your dotfiles, `~/.dotfiles` is a
   good place to start
2. Create your dotfiles folder and `cd` to it `mkdir -p ~/.dotfiles; cd
   ~/.dotfiles`
3. Initialize your dotgit repo with `dotgit init`. You can also skip the first
   two steps and clone an empty repo that you created somewhere e.g. on Github
   and run the init step inside the cloned repo.
4. Add your first dotfile `echo .bashrc >> filelist`
5. Update your dotgit repo (you need to do this whenever you change the
   filelist) with `dotgit update -v`. Once you do this your dotfile has been
   moved from your home directory to your dotfiles repo, and a symlink was
   created in your home directory in place of the original file pointing to the
   file inside your dotfiles repo.
6. Commit your changes to your dotgit repo by running `dotgit commit`

That's it! When you want to push your changes to your git remote you just do a
`git push` as usual (dotgit will also offer to do this for you).

If you change your dotfiles (e.g. you edit your `.bashrc` file) you don't need
to run an update operation again. You just cd into your dotfiles directory and
run `dotgit commit`. dotgit will generate a commit for you with a fitting
description and will offer to push your changes to your remote (should you have
one).

To restore your dotfiles on another machine, just clone your repo, install
dotgit and run `dotgit restore` inside your repo.

It is strongly recommended to look through dotgit's help by running `dotgit
--help`. This will show you good ways to use dotgit and explain dotgit's options
in detail.

## Example workflow

A typical workflow might look something like the following. In this example we
will set up two machines to use dotgit. The first will be named "laptop" and
the second "desktop". We want to share a ".vimrc" file between the two but have
separate ".xinitrc" files.

First we start on the laptop. On it we have the ".vimrc" file that we want to
share as well as the ".xinitrc" file for the laptop. We create a new dotgit
repo (cloning an empty repo or just making an empty dir) and init the repo by
running the following inside the repo dir:

```
[laptop]$ dotgit init
```

This command creates an empty filelist and also makes the first commit inside
the repo. Next, we set up our filelist. We will set up the complete filelist
now, since the ".xinitrc" file for the desktop won't be affected while we work
on the laptop (since it is in a separate category). We edit the filelist to
look as follows:

```
# dotgit filelist
.vimrc:laptop,desktop
.xinitrc:laptop
.xinitrc:desktop
```

Our filelist is now ready. To update the dotgit repo to match it we run the
update command inside the dotgit repo:

```
[laptop]$ dotgit update -v
```

Our repository now contains the newly-copied ".vimrc" file as well as the
".xinitrc" file for the laptop. To see these changes, we can run the diff
command:

```
[laptop]$ dotgit diff
```

We are now done on the laptop, so we commit our changes to the repo and push it
to the remote (something like GitHub):

```
[laptop]$ dotgit commit
```

Next, on the desktop we clone the repo to where we want to save it.  Assuming
that dotgit is already installed on the desktop we cd into the dotfiles repo.
We first want to replace the ".vimrc" on the desktop with the one stored in the
repo, so we run the restore command inside the repo:

```
[desktop]$ dotgit restore -v
```

Note that dotgit always replaces the file in the repo if the same file exists
in your home folder and you run the "update" command. To prevent this from
happening, run the restore command first in in the previous step.

We now want to store the ".xinitrc" file from the desktop in our dotgit repo,
so again we run the update operation.

```
[desktop]$ dotgit update -v
```

Again we save the changes to the dotfiles repo by committing it and pushing it
to the remote:

```
[desktop]$ dotgit commit
```

Now we're done! To pull in the changes made from the desktop to the laptop, run
"git pull" on the laptop. You might also need to run a "dotgit restore" on the
laptop if you added new files to the filelist on the desktop.

## Future goals

dotgit was written with a plugin architecture which allows easily extending it
with more functionality. The following plugins are on the wishlist for future
releases (more suggestions welcome):

* [x] Encryption using GnuPG
* [ ] Templating

## Migrating from v1.x

After many years dotgit was finally completely rewritten in python. The first
version was written in pure bash, and while this was appealing at first it
quickly became a nightmare from a maintenance point-of-view. The new python
rewrite comes with many advantages including:

* Much better cross-platform compatibility, especially for MacOS. Using
  utilities like `find` became problematic between different environments
* A fully automated test suite to test dotgit on both Linux and MacOS
* Code that the author can understand after not seeing it for a week
* Unified install method (pip) for all the platforms

After much consideration it was decided to rather to not re-implement the
directory support, which is the only major change functionality wise from the
first version. It requires a lot of special treatment that breaks some of the
logic that works very well for single files which lead to weird bugs and
behaviour in the first version. Excluding it made the file-handling logic much
more robust and the behaviour surrounding the handling of files is much more
predictable.

Should you decide you'd like to stick to the old version of dotgit, you are
welcome to do so. Installing the pip package will also make the original dotgit
available as the command "dotgit.sh" (AUR package as well). Please note that I
will not be able to support the old version anymore, and as such you're on your
own if you decide to use the old version.

To make room for future improvements, the layout of the dotgit dotfiles repos
had to change. Unfortunately this means that the new repos are not directly
compatible with the old ones, although it is easy to migrate to the new
version's format. To do so, do the following:

1. Firstly, backup your current dotfiles repo in case something goes wrong
2. Next, do a hard restore using the old dotgit so that it copies all your
   files from your repo to your home folder using `dotgit.sh hard-restore`
3. Now, delete your old dotgit files inside your repo as well as your
   cryptlist (which signals to dotgit that you are using the old version) using
   `rm -rf dotfiles dmz cryptlist passwd`. Encrypted files are now specified
   using the new plugin syntax (check the usage example earlier in the readme),
   so add them to your original filelist using the new syntax.
4. With the new version of dotgit, first run `dotgit init -v` and then run
   `dotgit update -v`. This will store the files from your home folder back in
   your repo in their new locations. If you have encrypted files this will also
   ask for your new encryption password
5. Commit the changes to your repo using either git or `dotgit commit`
6. Familiarize yourself with the new dotgit syntax which has changed slightly
   to better follow conventions commonly found on the command-line by reading
   through the help using `dotgit -h`
