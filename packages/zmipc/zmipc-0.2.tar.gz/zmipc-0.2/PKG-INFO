        ## Description
        
        A Zero-copy Memory-sharing based IPC which intends to be handy in some cases where socket-based communications do not work well.
        
        ## Getting Started
        
        The usage of zmipc intends to be straight-forward. Here is an example:
        
        ```python
        from zmipc import ZMClient
        
        sender = ZMClient()
        receiver = ZMClient()
        sender.add_publication(topic='test')
        receiver.add_subscription(topic'test')
        sender.publish(topic='test', msg='Hello World!')
        print(receiver.receive(topic='test'))
        ```
