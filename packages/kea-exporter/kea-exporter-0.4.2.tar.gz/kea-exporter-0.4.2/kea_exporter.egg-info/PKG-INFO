Description: kea-exporter
        ============
        
        Prometheus Exporter for the ISC Kea DHCP Server.
        
        From v0.4.0 on Kea >=1.3.0 is required, as the configuration, specifically
        subnet information, will be read from the control socket.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        The latest stable version can be installed from PyPi:
        
        ::
        
            $ pip install kea-exporter
        
        
        and upgraded with:
        
        ::
        
            $ pip install --upgrade kea-exporter
        
        Features
        --------
        
        - DHCP4 & DHCP6 Metrics (tested against Kea 1.6.0)
        - Configuration and statistics via control socket
        
        Currently not working:
        
        - Automatic config reload (through inotify)
        
        
        Known Limitations
        -----------------
        
        The following features are not supported yet, help is welcome.
        
        - HTTP REST API (as a means to query a Kea instance)
        - Shared Networks
        - Custom Subnet Identifiers
        
        Usage
        -----

        Configure Control Socket
        ////////////////////////
        
        The exporter uses Kea's control socket to request both configuration and 
        statistics. Consult the documentation on how to set up the control socket:
        
        - https://kea.readthedocs.io/en/latest/arm/dhcp4-srv.html#management-api-for-the-dhcpv4-server
        - https://kea.readthedocs.io/en/latest/arm/dhcp6-srv.html#management-api-for-the-dhcpv6-server
        
        Permissions
        ///////////
        
        Kea Exporter needs to be able to read and write on the socket, hence it's
        permissions might need to be modified accordingly.
