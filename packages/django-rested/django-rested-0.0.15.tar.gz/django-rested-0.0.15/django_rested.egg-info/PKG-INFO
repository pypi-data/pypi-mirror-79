Description: # Rested
        *Make creating rest APIs in Django simple.*
        
        Rested is a simple batteries included tool to make building rest API's using Django fast and easy.
        
        ## Usage
        
        #### Quick Start
        
        #### Command Line
        The command line interface has commands to start a dev server, run development shell, run tests, run Django management commands, create an empty example project, and run a Celery background task worker.
        
        #### Validation
          To validate a field you must start with a root validator: `to`, `am`, `accepts`, or `optional`.  All root
          validators check that a field is defined before proceeding with the exception of `optional` which will
          immediately accept if the field is undefined on the json object.

        #### Lauching Dev Stack
        Use docker compose to launch development stack.
        
        #### Running Tests
        To run tests:  
        `pytest`
        
        To run a specific test suite:  
        `pytest -s -k test_rested`
        
        To run a specific test in a suite:  
        `pytest -s -k "test_validate and test_check"`
        
        To run tests with auto reload:  
        `env PYTHONPATH="/rested/tests" ptw`
        
        To run tests with auto reload and specific test:  
        `env PYTHONPATH="/rested/tests" ptw --runner "pytest -s -k test_rested"`
        
        To see print statements of passing tests use the `-s` flag
        
        Note: Errors like this might have a root exception with more detail and may mean you are missing migrations:
        `psycopg2.errors.InvalidCursorName`
