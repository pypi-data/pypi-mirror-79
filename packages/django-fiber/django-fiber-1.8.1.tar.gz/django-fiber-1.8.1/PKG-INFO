        An important message about this project
        ---------------------------------------
        
        Hi Django Fiber enthusiasts! This project was started by the people at Ride The Pony, Leukeleu and Jouw Omgeving.
        They started Django Fiber in 2011, because they wanted a good, *simple* Django CMS available. Lots of people felt the
        same, which was why Django Fiber became pretty popular. And it is still going strong in lots of sites, so we hear :)
        
        Later, they discovered `Wagtail <https://wagtail.io/>`_, and found it to be even better than their own creation. So
        they decided to move on. Nevertheless, Django Fiber was popular, used in many websites, and they didn't want to just
        drop it. At the start of 2017 they handed over control of the project to a new group of maintainers - the discussion
        about this handover can be found in `issue #244 <https://github.com/django-fiber/django-fiber/issues/244>`_.
        
        Currently Django Fiber is in 'maintenance mode'. What this means it that it will be updated to run with the
        latest releases of Django - and of other packages that Django Fiber depends on. However, no effort will be made to
        add new features.
        
        If a user really wants a new feature added - then a well-written PR will be reviewed and considered. But other than
        that, Django Fiber is staying exactly as it is :)

        Requirements

        Installation
        ------------
        
        We're assuming you are using Django 1.9-2.0. Then simply install Fiber
        using pip::
        
            $ pip install django-fiber
        
        
        
        Setup
        ~~~~~
        
        Open **settings.py** and add the following to your INSTALLED_APPS
        
        ::
        
           INSTALLED_APPS = (
                ...
                'mptt',
                'compressor',
                'easy_thumbnails',
                'fiber',
                ...
           )
        
        Add Fiber to the MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES list
        
        ::
        
            import django.conf.global_settings as DEFAULT_SETTINGS
        
            MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES = DEFAULT_SETTINGS.MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES + (
                ...
                'fiber.middleware.ObfuscateEmailAddressMiddleware',
                'fiber.middleware.AdminPageMiddleware',
            )
        
        (Or, add the same items to ``MIDDLEWARE`` if you are using Django 1.10 or later.)
        
        Add the request context processor
        
        ::
        
            TEMPLATES = [
                {
                    ...
                    'OPTIONS': {
                        'context_processors': [
                            ...
                            'django.template.context_processors.request',
                        ]
                    }
                },
            ]
        
        And configure compressor
        
        ::
        
            BASE_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)))
        
            STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static')
            STATIC_URL = '/static/'
            STATICFILES_FINDERS = DEFAULT_SETTINGS.STATICFILES_FINDERS + [
                'compressor.finders.CompressorFinder',
            ]
        
        Edit your **urls.py** to add the Fiber site to your url-patterns
        
        ::
        
            from django.urls import include, path, re_path
            from fiber.views import page
        
            urlpatterns = [
                ...
                path('api/v2/', include('fiber.rest_api.urls')),
                path('admin/fiber/', include('fiber.admin_urls')),
                ...
                re_path('', page),
            ]
        
        Post-installation
        -----------------
        
        Create database tables::
        
            $ python manage.py migrate
        
        All static Fiber files need to be symlinked in (or copied to) your static files folder if you're not on your dev machine::
        
            $ python manage.py collectstatic --link
