LangTech Text Library (LTTL)
============================

LTTL is an open-source python package for text processing and analysis.

LTTL consists of: (i) a set of classes for representing segmental analyses of 
text strings (= "segmentations"), whereby portions of text strings are 
delineated and possibly annotated with specific labels; (ii) a set of classes 
for creating and manipulating segmentations, in order to produce either 
modified version of the original text data, or data tables summarizing 
properties of these data (e.g. unit frequency, complexity measures, 
concordances, and so on).

LTTL was designed and implemented by `LangTech Sarl <http://langtech.ch>`_.
