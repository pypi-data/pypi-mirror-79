    Description

    The BirdVox-70k dataset contains 70k half-second clips from 6 audio
    recordings in the BirdVox-full-night dataset, each about ten hours in
    duration. These recordings come from ROBIN autonomous recording units,
    placed near Ithaca, NY, USA during the fall 2015. They were captured on the
    night of September 23rd, 2015, by six different sensors, originally
    numbered 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 10.

    Andrew Farnsworth used the Raven software to pinpoint every avian flight
    call in time and frequency. He found 35402 flight calls in total.
    He estimates that about 25 different species of passerines (thrushes,
    warblers, and sparrows) are present in this recording. Species are not
    labeled in BirdVox-70k, but it is possible to tell apart thrushes from
    warblers and sparrows by looking at the center frequencies of their calls.
    The annotation process took 102 hours.

    The dataset can be used, among other things, for the research,development
    and testing of bioacoustic classification models, including the
    reproduction of the results reported in [1].

    For details on the hardware of ROBIN recording units, we refer the reader
    to [2].
