"""
Welcome to arcospy, the python version of the R arcos package maintained by
The Washington Post. arcospy is the result of a R-to-python translation
project carried out at the University of Maryland in the Fall of 2019.
The project was motivated by The Washington Postâ€™s data-driven story
on a large pain pill database recently made publicly available.

The arcospy module was built to offer the exact same functionality as arcos,
with the only difference being the ability to run the API calls in python!
All of the commands in arcospy inherit the names from the original commands
in arcos. Both arcos and arcospy act as wrappers for the DEA ARCOS dataset.
