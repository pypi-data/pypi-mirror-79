Description: # Data Commons Pandas API
        
        This is a Python library for creating pandas objects with data in the
        Data Commons Graph.
        
        To get started, install this package from pip.
        
            pip install datacommons_pandas
        
        Once the package is installed, import `datacommons_pandas`.
        
            import datacommons_pandas as dcpd
        
        For more detail on getting started with the API, please visit our
        [API Overview](http://docs.datacommons.org/api/).
        
        When you are ready to use the API, you can refer to `datacommons_pandas/examples` for
        examples on how to use this package to perform various tasks. More tutorials and
        documentation can be found on our [tutorials page](https://datacommons.org/colab)!
        
        ## About Data Commons
        
        [Data Commons](https://datacommons.org/) is an open knowledge repository that
        provides a unified view across multiple public data sets and statistics. You can
        view what [datasets](https://datacommons.org/datasets) are currently ingested
        and browse the graph using our [browser](https://browser.datacommons.org/).

        ## Development
        
        Please follow the [Development instructions](../README.md#development).
        
        ## Release to PyPI
        
        **If this is your first time releasing to PyPI**, please review the PyPI guide
        starting from the
        [setup section](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/#creating-setup-py).
        
        ### Release to Test PyPI
        
        1. Append "-USERNAME" to the package "NAME". For example,
        `NAME = 'foo_package-janedoe123'`.
        1. Increment the "VERSION" code to something that has not been used in your test
          project. This will not affect the production PyPI versioning.
        1. Build the dist
          ```
          python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade setuptools wheel
          python3 ../setup_datacommons_pandas.py sdist bdist_wheel
          ```
        1. Release the dist to TestPyPI.
          ```
          python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade twine
          python3 -m twine upload --repository testpypi ../dist/*
          ```
        
        ### Release to Production PyPI
        
        1. Revert the package name to `datacommons_pandas`
        1. Update and double check "VERSION" in [setup_datacommons.py](setup_datacommons.py)
        1. Update [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for a new version
        1. Clear the dist folder: `rm ../dist/*`
        1. Build the dist
          ```
          python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade setuptools wheel
          python3 ../setup_datacommons_pandas.py sdist bdist_wheel
          ```
        1. Release the dist to PyPI.
          ```
          python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade twine
          twine upload ../dist/*
          ```
