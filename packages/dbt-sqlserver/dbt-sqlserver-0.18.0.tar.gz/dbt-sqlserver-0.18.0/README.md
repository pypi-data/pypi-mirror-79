On Ubuntu make sure you have the ODBC header files before installing
    
    sudo apt install unixodbc-dev

## Configure your profile
Configure your dbt profile for using SQL Server authentication or Integrated Security:
##### SQL Server authentication 
      type: sqlserver
      driver: 'ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server' (The ODBC Driver installed on your system)
      server: server-host-name or ip
      port: 1433
      user: username
      password: password
      database: databasename
      schema: schemaname

##### Integrated Security
      type: sqlserver
      driver: 'ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server'
      server: server-host-name or ip
      port: 1433
      user: username
      schema: schemaname
      windows_login: True

## Supported features

### Materializations
- Table: 
    - Will be materialized as columns store index by default (requires SQL Server 2017 as least). To override:
{{
  config(
    as_columnstore = false,
  )
}}
- View
- Incremental
- Ephemeral

### Seeds

### Hooks

### Custom schemas

### Sources


### Testing & documentation
- Schema test supported
- Data tests supported from dbt 0.14.1
- Docs

### Snapshots
- Timestamp
- Check

But, columns in source table can not have any constraints. If for example any column has a NOT NULL constraint, an error will be thrown.

### Indexes
There is now possible to define a regular sql server index on a table. 
This is best used when the default clustered columnstore index materialisation is not suitable. 
One reason would be that you need a large table that usually is queried one row at a time.

Clusterad and non-clustered index are supported:
- create_clustered_index(columns, unique=False)
- create_nonclustered_index(columns, includes=False)
- drop_all_indexes_on_table(): Drops current indexex on a table. Only meaningfull if model is incremental.


Example of applying Unique clustered index on two columns, Ordinary index on one column, Ordinary index on one column with another column included

    {{
        config({
            "as_columnstore": false, 
            "materialized": 'table',
            "post-hook": [
                "{{ create_clustered_index(columns = ['row_id', 'row_id_complement'], unique=True) }}",
                "{{ create_nonclustered_index(columns = ['modified_date']) }}",
                "{{ create_nonclustered_index(columns = ['row_id'], includes = ['modified_date']) }}",
            ]
        })
    }}
