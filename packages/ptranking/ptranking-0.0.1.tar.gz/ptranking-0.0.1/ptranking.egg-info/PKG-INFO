Description: # Introduction
        
        This open-source project, referred to as **PTRanking** (Learning to Rank in PyTorch) aims to provide scalable and extendable implementations of typical learning-to-rank methods based on PyTorch. On one hand, this project enables a uniform comparison over several benchmark datasets leading to an in-depth understanding of previous learning-to-rank methods. On the other hand, this project makes it easy to develop and incorporate newly proposed models, so as to expand the territory of techniques on learning-to-rank. 
        
        **Key Features**:
        
        - A number of representative learning-to-rank models, including not only the traditional optimization framework via empirical risk minimization but also the adversarial optimization framework
        - Supports widely used benchmark datasets. Meanwhile, random masking of the ground-truth labels with a specified ratio is also supported
        - Supports different metrics, such as Precision, MAP, nDCG and nERR
        - Highly configurable functionalities for fine-tuning hyper-parameters, e.g., grid-search over hyper-parameters of a specific model
        - Provides easy-to-use APIs for developing a new learning-to-rank model
        
        # How-to-Start and Learning more
        
        ## Get Started
        
        1. Prepare a virtual environment with Python 3.*  via `conda`, `venv` or others.
         
        2. Install Pytorch following the [instructions](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)
        
        3. Install scikit-learn following the [instructions](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html#installation-instructions)
        
        4. Install ptranking: pip install ptranking
        
        ## Command-line Usage
        
        1. Download [Supported Datasets](#dataset)
        
        2. Run the following command script on your Terminal/Command Prompt:
        
        ```
        python ptranking -data [DATASETNAME] -dir_data [DATASET_DIR] -dir_output [OUTPUT_DIR] -model [MODELNAME]
        ```
        
        e.g.:
        ```
        python ptranking -data MQ2008_Super -dir_data /home/dl-box/dataset/MQ2008/ -dir_output /home/dl-box/WorkBench/CodeBench/Project_output/Out_L2R/Listwise/ -model ListMLE
        ```
        
        ## Demo Scripts
        
        To get a taste of learning-to-rank models without writing any code, you could try the following script. You just need to specify the model name, the dataset id, as well as the directories for input and output.
        
        - [Jupyter Notebook example on RankNet & LambdaRank](example/ptranking_demo_ltr.ipynb)
        
        To get familiar with the process of data loading, you could try the following script, namely, get the statistics of a dataset. 
        
        - [Jupyter Notebook example on getting dataset statistics](example/ptranking_demo_dataset_statistics.ipynb)
        
        ## Develop a new model based on PT-Ranking
        
        PT-Ranking offers deep neural networks as the basis to construct a scoring function based on PyTorch and can thus fully leverage the advantages of PyTorch. 
        NeuralRanker is a class that represents a general learning-to-rank model. 
        A key component of NeuralRanker is the neural scoring function. The configurable hyper-parameters include activation function, number of layers, number of neurons per layer, etc. 
        All specific learning-to-rank models inherit NeuralRanker and mainly differ in the way of computing the training loss.
         The following figure shows the main step in developing a new learning-to-rank model based on Empirical Risk Minimization, 
         where batch_preds and batch_stds correspond to outputs of the scoring function and ground-truth lables, respectively. 
         We can observe that the main work is to define the surrogate loss function.

        ## Parameter Setting
        
        An easy-to-use parameter setting is necessary for any ML library. PT-Ranking offers a self-contained strategy.
        In other words, we appeals to particularly designed class objects for setting. For example, **DataSetting** for data loading, **EvalSetting** for evaluation setting and **ModelParameter** for a model's parameter setting. 
        
        When incorporating a newly developed model (say ModelA), it is commonly required to develop the subclass ModelAParameter by inheriting **[ModelParameter](ptranking/eval/parameter.py)** and customizing the functions, such as to_para_string(), default_para_dict() and grid_search(). Please refer to [LambdaRankParameter](ptranking/ltr_adhoc/listwise/lambdarank.py) as an example.
        
        Thanks to this strategy, on one hand, we can initialize the settings for data-loading, evaluation, and models in a simple way. On the other hand, the parameter setting of a model is self-contained, and easy to customize.
        
        To fully leverage PT-Ranking, one needs to [be familiar with PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html).

        ## The widely used benchmark datasets listed below can be directly used once downloaded
        
        -- **[LETOR4.0](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/letor-learning-rank-information-retrieval/)**
        (including MQ2007 \| MQ2008 \| MQ2007-semi \| MQ2008-semi \| MQ2007-list \| MQ2008-list )
        
        -- **[MSLR-WEB10K](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/mslr/)** (including MSLR-WEB10K \| MSLR-WEB30K)
        
        -- **[Yahoo! LETOR](https://webscope.sandbox.yahoo.com/catalog.php?datatype=c)** (including Set1 \| Set2)
        
        -- **[Istella](http://quickrank.isti.cnr.it/istella-dataset/)** (including Istella-S \| Istella \| Istella-X)
        
        ### Some notes on the above datasets
        
        - Semi-supervised datasets (MQ2007-semi | MQ2008-semi) have the same format as that for supervised ranking setting. The only difference is that the semi-supervised datasets in this setting contain both judged and undged query-document pairs
         (**in training set but not in validation and testing set**)(The relevance label “-1” indicates the query-document pair is not judged) while the datasets for supervised ranking contain only judged query-document pair.
        
        - According to [Introducing LETOR 4.0 Datasets}](https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.2597), queryLevelNorm version refers to that: conduct query level normalization in the way of using MIN. This data can be directly used for learning. 
        They further provide 5-fold partitions of this version for cross fold validation. Thus there is no need to perform query_level_scale again for {MQ2007_super | MQ2008_super | MQ2007_semi | MQ2008_semi}. 
        But for {MSLRWEB10K | MSLRWEB30K}, the query-level normalization is **not conducted yet**.
        
        - For Yahoo! LETOR, the query-level normalization is already done.
        
        - For Istella! LETOR, the query-level normalization is **not conducted yet**. We note that ISTELLA contains extremely large features, e.g., 1.79769313486e+308, we replace features of this kind with a constant 1000000.
        
        ## PT-Ranking currently supports to ingest data with the LibSVM formats
        
        - LETOR datasets in LibSVM format
        
        \<ground-truth label int\> qid\:<query_id int> <feature_id int>:<feature_value float> ... <feature_id int>:<feature_value float>
        
        For example:
        
        4 qid:105 2:0.4  8:0.7   50:0.5
        
        
        1 qid:105 5:0.5  30:0.7  32:0.4  48:0.53
        
        0 qid:210 4:0.9  38:0.01 39:0.5  45:0.7
        
        1 qid:210 1:0.2  8:0.9   31:0.93 40:0.6
        
        The above sample dataset includes two queries, the query "105" has 2 documents, the corresponding ground-truth labels are 4 and 1, respectively.
        
        - Converting LETOR datasets into LibSVM format with a corresponding **group** file
        
        This functionality is required when using the implementation of LambdaMART provided in [LightGBM](https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
