        `mrsimulator` is an open-source python package for fast computation/analysis of solid-state
        magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra of both crystalline and amorphous materials. The core
        of the `mrsimulator` library is written in C, wrapped, and made available in python.
        
        > :warning: The package is currently under development. We advice using with caution. Bug report are greatly appreciated.
        
        ## Why use mrsimulator?
        
        - It is open-source and free.
        - It is a fast and versatile solid-state NMR simulator of one-dimensional static, MAS,
          and VAS spectra of nuclei experiencing chemical shift (nuclear shielding) and quadrupolar
          coupling interactions.
        - Future release will include simulations of weakly coupled nuclei experiencing J and dipolar
          couplings, and multi-dimensional NMR spectra.
        - It is fully documented with a stable and simple API and is easily incorporated into your
          python scripts and web apps.
        - It is compatible with modern python packages, such as scikit-learn, Keras, etc.

        ### Features
        
        The `mrsimulator` package currently offers the following
        
        - **Fast simulation** of one-dimensional solid-state NMR spectra. See our
          [benchmark results](https://mrsimulator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/benchmark.html).
        
        - Simulation of **uncoupled spin system**
        
          - for spin I=1/2, and quadrupole I>1/2 nuclei,
          - at arbitrary macroscopic magnetic flux density,
          - at arbitrary rotor angles, and
          - at arbitrary spinning frequency.
        
        - The library includes the following **NMR methods**,
        
          - 1D Bloch decay spectrum, and
          - 1D Bloch decay central transition spectrum.
        
        - **Models** for tensor parameter distribution in amorphous materials.

        ### Goals for the near future
        
        Our current objectives for the future are the following
        
        - Include spectral simulation of coupled spin systems for
        
          - spin I=1/2, and quadrupole I>1/2 nuclei,
          - at arbitrary macroscopic magnetic flux density,
          - at arbitrary rotor angles, and
          - at arbitrary spinning frequency.
        
        - Expand the library of NMR methods. We expect to include the following methods
        
          - 2D Multi-Quantum Magic Angle Spinning (MQ-MAS),
          - 2D isotropic/anisotropic sideband correlation spectrum (e.g. PASS and MAT).
          - 2D Dynamic Angle Spinning (DAS), and
          - 2D Magic Angle Flipping (MAF).

        [documentation](https://mrsimulator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
        
        ## Installation
        
            $ pip install mrsimulator
        
        Please read our [installation document](https://mrsimulator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) for details.
        
        ## Check your build
        
        If the installation is successful, you should be able to run the following
        [test file](https://raw.github.com/DeepanshS/mrsimulator-examples/master/test_file_v0.3.py?raw=true)
        in your terminal.
        
            $ python test_file.py
        
        This should produce the following figure.
