Code specific to modelling Rockets.  
Main class is `Rocket.Rocket`.

Other files define models for specific rocket components or stages.  
In general the responsibility of rocket component classes is to model:

1. The forces/moments (aerodynamic or otherwise (excluding gravitational forces)) applied to the rocket by that rocket component
2. The inertia of that rocket component

The interface all rocket components are expected to implement is defined by the abstract base class `MAPLEAF.Rocket.RocketComponents.RocketComponent`. All rocket components inherit from this base class.
