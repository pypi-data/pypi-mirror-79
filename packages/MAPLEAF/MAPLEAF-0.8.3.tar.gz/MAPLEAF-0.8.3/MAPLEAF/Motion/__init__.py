Generalized Rigid body motion integration functionality.
Main class (6Dof) is `MAPLEAF.Motion.RigidBody.RigidBody`.  
Fundamental data types used throughout the simulator defined in:

* `Vector`
* `Quaternion` - represents orientation
* `AngularVelocity` 
* `Inertia` - stores component masses and moments of inertias
* `ForceMomentSystem`  - stores a repositionable force-moment system

3Dof and 6DoF Rigid body states are composed of these fundamental data types and defined in `RigidBodyStates`

Generalized constant and adaptive time stepping integrators are defined in `Integration`
