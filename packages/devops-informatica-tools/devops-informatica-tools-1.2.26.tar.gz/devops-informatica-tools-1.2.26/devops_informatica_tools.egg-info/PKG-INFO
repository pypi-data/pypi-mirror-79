Description: # CI-CD Pipeline, Provisioning and Maintenance components for Informatica projects
        
        ## Dependencies
        
        * Crypto module for password encryption. Depending on the method you want to use, you need to install one of the following packages:
          pip install pycryptodome
          pip install cryptography
        * setuptools for upload and download of Nexus artifacts
          pip install setuptools
        
        ## Checks after installation
        
        ### Check if encryption works
        
        * Create a virtualenv
        * Run:  python3 supporting/encryption.py
          Output: Hello encrypted world!

        ## Principles
        
        ### deploy lists
        
        * All components expect a deploylist text file as input. You should keep deploylists in your source code Git. Suggested location:
        <root>/<feature>/config/<deploylist> where <root> is the base location within your Git, <feature> is your submodule (if any), and <deploylist> is the text file that contains the items to be deployed.
          For example:
          <myGit>/demo/config/oracle_deploylist.txt
          <myGit>/demo/config/infa_deploylist.txt
        
        ### environment variables
        
        * The python scripts use environment variables to determine locations, features and many other parameters. The environment variables that can or at times must be set can be found in:
          * generalSettings: log directory, artifact directory, configuration directory and more
          * infaSettings: deploy list location, Informatica source and target variables like INFA_HOME, location infacmd, connectivity to domain and Model Repository
          * dbSettings: deploy list location, location of sql files, sqlprefix
        
        ## Examples
