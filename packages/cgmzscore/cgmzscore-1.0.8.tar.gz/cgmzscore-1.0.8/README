from cgmzscore import Calculator
calculator=Calculator()


v=calculator.zScore_wfa(weight="7.853",muac="13.5",age_in_months='16',sex='M',height='73')-->Use to calculate z score for weight vs age
v=calculator.zScore_wfl(weight="7.853",muac="13.5",age_in_months='16',sex='M',height='73')-->Use to calculate z score for weight vs length/height
v=calculator.zScore_wfh(weight="7.853",muac="13.5",age_in_months='16',sex='M',height='73')-->Use to calculate z score for weight vs length/height
both wfl and wfh works same
v=calculator.zScore_lhfa(weight="7.853",muac="13.5",age_in_months='16',sex='M',height='73')-->Use to calculate z score for length vs age

v=calculator.zScore(weight="7.853",muac="13.5",age_in_months='16',sex='M',height='73')-->Use to calculate all three z score
v=calculator.zScore_withclass(weight="7.853",muac="13.5",age_in_months='16',sex='M',height='73')-->Use to calculate all three z score along with class
v=calculator.SAM_MAM(weight="7.853",muac="13.5",age_in_months='16',sex='M',height='73')-->Use to find child is SAM/MAM/Healthy
