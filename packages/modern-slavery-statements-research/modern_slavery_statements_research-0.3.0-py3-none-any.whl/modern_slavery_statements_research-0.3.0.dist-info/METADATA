# Research on Modern Slavery 

This repository is going to contain a collection of experiments and analyses performed on the Modern Slavery Statements Dataset.


## Introduction
[The UN Sustainable Development Goal 8.7](https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg8) states:
Take immediate and effective measures to eradicate forced labour, end modern slavery and human trafficking and secure the prohibition and elimination of the worst forms of child labour, including recruitment and use of child soldiers, and by 2025 end child labour in all its forms.

In 2018, [the Global Slavery Index](https://www.globalslaveryindex.org/2018/findings/highlights/) found that there were 40.3 M people in modern slavery, of whom 25M were in forced labor producing computers, clothing, agricultural products, raw materials, etc and 15M were in forced marriage.

[The Future Society](https://thefuturesociety.org/), an independent nonprofit think-and-do tank [launched a partnership](https://thefuturesociety.org/2020/06/23/project-aims-artificial-intelligence-against-modern-slavery/) with the [Walk Free Initiative](https://www.minderoo.org/walk-free/) to automate the analysis of modern slavery statements produced by businesses to boost compliance and help combat and eradicate modern slavery. [The team](https://thefuturesociety.org/our-team/) at The Future Society is curating an up-to-date repository of >16K modern slavery statements (and counting) to boost machine learning research in this area. The data is scraped based on the collection of report links provided by the [modernslaveryregistry.org](modernslaveryregistry.org).

By sharing your analysis and contributing to this repository you help the global community to hold multi-national corporations accountable for how they treat their workforce and suppliers.


### Prerequisites

- [Python 3.6+](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3611/) installed on your system
- If you'd like to use the provided tutorials, you also need access to a [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/install.html)

### Quickstart

It's recommended that you use a virtual environment such as [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/), [pipenv](https://pipenv-fork.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) or similar.


#### Option 1 - notebook
Copy [this notebook](https://github.com/the-future-society/modern-slavery-statements-research/blob/master/notebooks/Tutorial%20-%20Download%20Modern%20Slavery%20Corpus.ipynb) and follow the instructions.


#### Option 2 - command line

Install the package:
```
pip install modern-slavery-statements-research
```

Specify your AWS access credentials as `-i` (aws access key id) and `-a` (secret access key) arguments and run (without the curly brackets):
```
download-corpus -i {aws_access_key_id} -a {aws secret access key}
```
The logs printed in the console will tell you the name of the data folder.


If you've set up your modern slavery project related [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) credentials as default you can simply run
```
download-corpus
```

You can explore more options by running `download-corpus --help`

As the corpus is a work in progress, all feedback is welcomed in the Repository issues 
at present, if you'd like to work with this data, please send an email to edgar@bravetech.io with a link to your social profile (linkedin, facebook or similar ) and you'll receive IAM user credentials on the first possible instance that would allow you to download and access the data.



## Get Help
If you'd like to get help with domain expertise or technical requirements and implementations then get in touch with [Adriana](mailto:adriana.bora@thefuturesociety.org) or [Edgar](mailto:edgar@bravetech.io) respectively.


## Roadmap

Over the next few weeks and months, the following improvements are planned to the dataset and the repository:

1. ~~Provide a convenient one-command entry point to the data~~
2. ~~Improve the dataset quality by continuously including more documents and improving the data cleaning pipeline.~~
3. ~~Provide examples of analysis.~~
4. Provide manually annotaded labels for a subset of the corpus to enable analyses using supervised methods.
5. Open source the data and research for public access.
