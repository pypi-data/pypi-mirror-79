Description: # hdfio
        All the useful python I/O utility functions for HDF5 files
        
        ## Rationale
        Writing this software package aggregator is motivated by the multitude of read/write functions currently existing in the python open source community. The package combines existing mature hdf(5) I/O source code and a few similar isolated functions into a single simple and user-friendly platform to save the labor of writing newer functions of similar capabilities.
