Description: # pypolona
        
        **[PyPolona](https://twardoch.github.io/pypolona/)** is a free and open-source GUI (graphical) app that allows you to search in and download images from the [Polona.pl](https://polona.pl/) digital library. It also works as a `ppolona` CLI (command-line) tool. And it’s a Python package available from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pypolona/). The source is on [Github](https://github.com/twardoch/pypolona).
        
        **Polona.pl** provides digitized books, magazines, graphics, maps, music, fliers and manuscripts from collections of the National Library of Poland and co-operating institutions.
        
        With PyPolona, you can:
        
        - search Polona
        - print or save the search results as a list of URLs, a YAML file, a JSON file and a simple list of Polona document IDs
        - download all or some high-resolution images from Polona for the search results, or for a provided list of Polona document IDs
        
        The PyPolona GUI version is made from the command-line version, and uses the same settings as the `ppolona` tool.
        
        ## Install standalone PyPolona app
        
        ### <a class="github-button btn btn-primary" href="https://github.com/twardoch/pypolona/raw/master/download/pypolona-mac.dmg" data-color-scheme="no-preference: dark; light: dark; dark: dark;" data-icon="octicon-download" data-size="large" aria-label="Download DMG for macOS">Download DMG for macOS</a>
        
        On **macOS**, double-click the downloaded DMG, drag the icon to the `/Applications` folder. Then Ctrl+click the icon and choose Open, then click Open to open the GUI. Later, you can just double-click the icon. If the app does not run, double-click again.
        
        ### <a class="github-button btn btn-primary" href="https://github.com/twardoch/pypolona/raw/master/download/pypolona-win.zip" data-color-scheme="no-preference: dark; light: dark; dark: dark;" data-icon="octicon-download" data-size="large" aria-label="Download ZIP for Windows">Download ZIP for Windows</a>
        
        On **Windows**, unzip the downloaded ZIP, double-click the `setup_pypolona.exe` icon to install the app. You need 64-bit Windows.
        
        ## Install pypolona Python package on macOS or Windows
        
        If you have Python 3.8+, you can install the Python version with `python3 -m pip install pypolona`.
        
        ## Using the graphical PyPolona app (GUI)
        
        - If you installed the standalone app on macOS, **Ctrl**-click **`/Applications/PyPolona.app`** and choose **Open**, then choose **Open**. You can just double-click the next time to run it.
        - If you installed the standalone app on Windows, run **`PyPolona`** from your start menu.
        - If you installed the Python version, run `ppolona` or `python3 -m pypolona`
        
        ### Input tab
        
        ![Input tab](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/twardoch/pypolona/master/docs/img/pypolona1.png)
        
        In the Input tab:
        
        In **query**, you can paste one or more URLs from Polona.pl (space-separated)
        
        Turn on **download** to download the images from the queried result, go to the **Download options** tab to customize the download location and set a max limit
        
        In **Choose One** you can change what the **query** field means:
        
        - **search**: choose this and in the **query** field, enter a simple search query like `adam mickiewicz`; go to the **Search options** tab to customize
        - **advanced**: you can use the advanced query syntax, see [documentation](https://polona.pl/api/entities/); go to the **Search options** tab to customize
        - **ids**: Polona uses IDs for documents, you can just paste a list of space-separated IDs if you already know them
        
        ### Search options tab
        
        ![Search options tab](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/twardoch/pypolona/master/docs/img/pypolona2.png)
        
        In **language**, you can enter a space-separated list of languages like Polona uses them, e.g. `polski niemiecki angielski`. Use the sidebar on the [Polona](https://polona.pl) website to find them.
        
        In **sort**, you can sort the results by score, date, title or creator, in ascending or descending order.
        
        In **format**, you can choose a format in which search results will be output. If you choose ids, you click **Restart** and then paste them back into the query field.
        
        In **save results**, you can optionally save the search results into the file.
        
        ### Download options tab
        
        ![Download options tab](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/twardoch/pypolona/master/docs/img/pypolona3.png)
        
        In **download to folder**, you can choose into which folder the app will download the images. By default it uses the `polona` subfolder on your desktop. When you start the download, the app will create subfolders inside, one per document. The folder names start with the publication year, then part of the title, then the ID.
        
        Turn on **overwrite**, and the app will re-download previously downloaded documents. If off, it will skip them.
        
        In **number of pages**, you can limit the maximum number of pages that the app downloads for each document. This is useful for test downloads, since some documents may have hundreds or pages.
        
        ### Buttons
        
        - Click **Start** to start the search or download.
        - Click **Cancel** to close the app.
        - If you’ve started and the search or download has finished, you can:
          - click **Restart** to start the search or download with the same settings
          - click **Edit** to go back to change the settings, so you can start another search or download.
        - If the download is running, you can click **Stop** to interrupt it.
        
        ## Using the CLI
        
        _Note: the CLI is `ppolona`, not `pypolona`_
        
        - If you installed the standalone DMG on macOS, use the CLI via `/Applications/PyPolona.app/Contents/MacOS/ppolona -h`
        - If you installed the Python version, run `ppolona -h` or `python3 -m pypolona -h`

        ## More about Polona
        
        The [Polona](https://polona.pl/) is a bit overcomplicated to use, but fortunately, Polona publishes a [JSON API](https://polona.pl/api/entities/). The pypolona package uses that API.
        
        - [Polona](https://polona.pl/) — the main Polona website
        - [Polona/API](https://polona.pl/api/entities/) — the JSON API that pypolona uses
        - [Polona/blog](http://www.blog.polona.pl/) — the blog
        - [Polona/typo](http://typo.polona.pl/en/) — a cool minisite that lets you typeset a word and renders it with letters from random publications
        
        ## Development
        
        - This project uses [Gooey](https://github.com/chriskiehl/Gooey). With Gooey, I could rapidly turn the Python command-line app which uses the `argparse` module into a simple GUI app. This project serves as a good example in how this can be done.
        - This project uses [PyInstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org/) to build the standalone app.
