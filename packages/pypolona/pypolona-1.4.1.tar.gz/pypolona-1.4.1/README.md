# pypolona

**[PyPolona](https://twardoch.github.io/pypolona/)** is a free and open-source GUI (graphical) app that allows you to search in and download images from the [Polona.pl](https://polona.pl/) digital library. It also works as a `ppolona` CLI (command-line) tool. And it’s a Python package available from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pypolona/). The source is on [Github](https://github.com/twardoch/pypolona).

**Polona.pl** provides digitized books, magazines, graphics, maps, music, fliers and manuscripts from collections of the National Library of Poland and co-operating institutions.

With PyPolona, you can:

- search Polona
- print or save the search results as a list of URLs, a YAML file, a JSON file and a simple list of Polona document IDs
- download all or some high-resolution images from Polona for the search results, or for a provided list of Polona document IDs

The PyPolona GUI version is made from the command-line version, and uses the same settings as the `ppolona` tool.

## Install standalone PyPolona app

### <a class="github-button btn btn-primary" href="https://github.com/twardoch/pypolona/raw/master/download/pypolona-mac.dmg" data-color-scheme="no-preference: dark; light: dark; dark: dark;" data-icon="octicon-download" data-size="large" aria-label="Download DMG for macOS">Download DMG for macOS</a>

When you **run the app for the first time**, **Ctrl**+click the icon and choose **Open**, then click **Open**. Later, you can just double-click the icon. If the app does not run, double-click again.

### <a class="github-button btn btn-primary" href="https://github.com/twardoch/pypolona/raw/master/download/pypolona-win.zip" data-color-scheme="no-preference: dark; light: dark; dark: dark;" data-icon="octicon-download" data-size="large" aria-label="Download ZIP for Windows">Download ZIP for Windows</a>

On **Windows**, unzip the downloaded ZIP, double-click the `setup_pypolona.exe` icon to install the app. You need 64-bit Windows.

## Install pypolona Python package on macOS or Windows

If you have Python 3.8+, you can install the Python version with `python3 -m pip install pypolona`.

## Using the graphical PyPolona app (GUI)

- If you installed the standalone app on macOS, **Ctrl**-click **`/Applications/PyPolona.app`** and choose **Open**, then choose **Open**. You can just double-click the next time to run it.
- If you installed the standalone app on Windows, run **`PyPolona`** from your start menu.
- If you installed the Python version, run `ppolona` or `python3 -m pypolona`

### Input tab

![Input tab](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/twardoch/pypolona/master/docs/img/pypolona_url.png)

In the Input tab:

In **query**, you can paste one or more URLs from Polona.pl (space-separated).

Turn on **Download images** to download the images from the queried result, go to the **Options** tab to customize the download location and set a max limit

![Search in input](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/twardoch/pypolona/master/docs/img/pypolona_search.png)

In **Choose One** you can change what the **query** field means:

- if nothing is selected, the query is interpreted as one or more URLs from Polona.pl
- **search**: choose this and in the **query** field, enter a simple search query like `adam mickiewicz`; go to the **Options** tab to customize
- **advanced**: you can use the advanced query syntax, see [documentation](https://polona.pl/api/entities/); go to the **Options** tab to customize
- **ids**: Polona uses IDs for documents, you can just paste a list of space-separated IDs if you already know them

### Options tab

![Options](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/twardoch/pypolona/master/docs/img/pypolona_options.png)

In **Space-separated languages**, you can enter a space-separated list of languages like Polona uses them, e.g. `polski niemiecki angielski`. Use the sidebar on the [Polona](https://polona.pl) website to find them.

In **Sort search**, you can sort the results by score, date, title or creator, in ascending or descending order.

In **Output search results in format**, you can choose a format in which search results will be output. If you choose ids, you click **Restart** and then paste them back into the query field. Choose urls to get clickable links.

In **Save search results**, you can optionally save the search results into the file.

In **Download images into subfolders**, you can choose into which folder the app will download the images. By default it uses the `polona` subfolder on your desktop. When you start the download, the app will create subfolders inside, one per document. The folder names start with the publication year, then part of the title, then the ID.

Turn on **Overwrite**, and the app will re-download previously downloaded documents. If off, it will skip them.

In **Max number of pages**, you can limit the maximum number of pages that the app downloads for each document. This is useful for test downloads, since some documents may have hundreds or pages.

### Buttons

![Result](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/twardoch/pypolona/master/docs/img/pypolona_result_urls.png)

- Click **Start** to start the search or download.
- Click **Cancel** to close the app.
- If you’ve started and the search or download has finished, you can:
  - click **Restart** to start the search or download with the same settings
  - click **Edit** to go back to change the settings, so you can start another search or download.
- If the download is running, you can click **Stop** to interrupt it.

## Using the CLI

_Note: the CLI is `ppolona`, not `pypolona`_

- If you installed the standalone DMG on macOS, use the CLI via `/Applications/PyPolona.app/Contents/MacOS/ppolona -h`
- If you installed the Python version, run `ppolona -h` or `python3 -m pypolona -h`
- Command-line options:

```

## More about Polona

The [Polona](https://polona.pl/) is a bit overcomplicated to use, but fortunately, Polona publishes a [JSON API](https://polona.pl/api/entities/). The pypolona package uses that API.

- [Polona](https://polona.pl/) — the main Polona website
- [Polona/API](https://polona.pl/api/entities/) — the JSON API that pypolona uses
- [Polona/blog](http://www.blog.polona.pl/) — the blog
- [Polona/typo](http://typo.polona.pl/en/) — a cool minisite that lets you typeset a word and renders it with letters from random publications

## Development

- This project uses [Gooey](https://github.com/chriskiehl/Gooey). With Gooey, I could rapidly turn the Python command-line app which uses the `argparse` module into a simple GUI app. This project serves as a good example in how this can be done.
- This project uses [PyInstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org/) to build the standalone app.

### Building on macOS

To build the Python package, the Mac DMG and the Win EXE (via Wine):

```
./macdeploy prep && ./macdeploy build
```

### Building on Windows

1. Install Python 3.8 from [Python.org](https://www.python.org/) (not the Windows Store!)
2. Install [Inno Setup](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php)

```
pip3 install --user --upgrade .[dev]
python -m PyInstaller --distpath="app/build/dist-win" --workpath="app/build" -y "app/pyinstaller-win.spec"
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Inno Setup 6\ISCC.exe" /dMyAppVersion="1.1.7" app/pypolona.iss /Q
```
