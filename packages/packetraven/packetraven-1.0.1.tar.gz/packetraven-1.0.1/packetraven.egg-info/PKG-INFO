        PacketRaven is a front-end data aggregator / dashboard, designed to track the progress of high-altitude balloon payload flights via location telemetry.
        
        ```bash
        pip install packetraven
        ```
        
        #### Usage:
        to start the client, run the following:
        ```bash
        packetraven <serial_port> [log_file] [output_file]
        ```
        or start the graphical interface:
        ```bash
        packetraven_gui
        ```
        
        #### Python API:
        to retrieve packets directly from https://aprs.fi:
        ```python
        from packetraven import BALLOON_CALLSIGNS, APRS_fi
        
        api_key = '' # enter your APRS.fi API key here - you can get a free API key from https://aprs.fi/page/api
        
        aprs_fi = APRS_fi(BALLOON_CALLSIGNS, api_key)
        aprs_fi_packets = aprs_fi.packets
        
        print(aprs_fi_packets)
        ```
        or parse packets from a radio sending parsed APRS over a USB connection:
        ```python
        from packetraven import PacketRadio
         
        serial_port = None # leave None to let PacketRaven guess the port name  
        
        radio = PacketRadio(serial_port)
        radio_packets = radio.packets
        
        print(radio_packets)
        ```
        
        #### Features:
        ###### current:
        - parse APRS packets from USB radio
        - retrieve packets from https://aprs.fi
        - output packets to file
        - plot altitude
        
        ###### in development:
        - flight track plotting
        - live track prediction
        - Iridium telemetry and commands
        - live chase navigation
