### <a name = "what">What is it?</a>

Pyleoclim is a Python package primarily geared towards the analysis and visualization of paleoclimate data. Such data often come in the form of timeseries with missing values and age uncertainties, so the package includes several low-level methods to deal with these issues, as well as high-level methods that re-use those within scientific workflows.

High-level modules assume that data are stored in the Linked Paleo Data ([LiPD](http://www.clim-past.net/12/1093/2016/)) format and makes extensive use of the [LiPD utilities](http://nickmckay.github.io/LiPD-utilities/). Low-level modules are primarily based on [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org) arrays or [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) dataframes, so Pyleoclim contains a lot of timeseries analysis code (e.g. spectral analysis, singular spectrum analysis, wavelet analysis, correlation analysis) that can apply to these more common types as well. See the example folder for details.

The package is aware of age ensembles stored via LiPD and uses them for time-uncertain analyses very much like [GeoChronR](http://nickmckay.github.io/GeoChronR/).

**Current capabilities**:
 - binning
 - interpolation
 - standardization
 - plotting maps, timeseries, and basic age model information
 - paleo-aware correlation analysis (isopersistent, isospectral and classical t-test)
 - weighted wavelet Z transform (WWZ)
 - age modeling through Bchron

**Future capabilities**:
 - paleo-aware singular spectrum analysis (AR(1) null eigenvalue identification, missing data)
 - spectral analysis (Multi-Taper Method, Lomb-Scargle)
 - cross-wavelet analysis
 - index reconstruction
 - climate reconstruction
 - causality
 - ensemble methods for most of the above

### <a name = "install"> Installation </a>

Python v3.6+ is **required**.

We recommend using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/), with an environment dedicated to Pyleoclim. See the [documentation](http://linkedearth.github.io/Pyleoclim_util/Introduction.html#installation) for details.

To install Pyleoclim, **first** install numpy and Cartopy through Anaconda (`conda`)
```
conda install numpy
```

```
conda install -c conda-forge cartopy
```
Then install pyleoclim via `pip`
```
pip install pyleoclim
```

Note that the `pip` command line above will trigger the installation of (most of) the dependencies,
as well as the local compilation of the Fortran code for WWZ with the GNU Fortran compiler `gfortran`.
If you have the Intel's Fortran compiler `ifort` installed, then further accerlation for WWZ could be
achieved by compiling the Fortran code with `ifort`, and below are the steps:
+ download the source code, either via `git clone` or just download the .zip file
+ modify `setup.py` by commenting out the line of `extra_f90_compile_args` for `gfortran`, and use the line below for `ifort`
+ run `python setup.py build_ext --fcompiler=intelem && python setup.py install`


Some functionalities require [R](https://www.r-project.org/about.html).

### <a name ="quickstart"> Quickstart guide </a>

1. [Install](#install) Pyleoclim.

3. Wait for installation to complete, then:

    3a. Import the package into your favorite Python environment (we recommend the use of Spyder, which comes standard with the Anaconda package)

    3b. Use Jupyter Notebook to go through the tutorial contained in the `PyleoclimQuickstart.ipynb` Notebook, which can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/LinkedEarth/Pyleoclim_util/tree/master/Example). The folder also contains a collection of LiPD files. More LiPD files available [here](http://wiki.linked.earth).

4. Help with functionalities can be found in the [Documentation](http://linkedearth.github.io/Pyleoclim_util/).
