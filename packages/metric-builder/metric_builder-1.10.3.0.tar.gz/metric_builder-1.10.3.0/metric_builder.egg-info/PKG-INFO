Description: # Metric Builder
        
        Utility for building templated metric extraction queries that can be traversed through time.
        
        ## Prerequisites
        
        You will need the following to run this code:
          * Python 3
          
        ## Installation
        
        To be determined...
        
        ## Usage
        
        In order to extract a given metric, a `Metric` object needs to be instantiated:
        
        ```python
        metric = Metric(
            query="""
                SELECT count(*) AS total
                FROM `project.dataset.table`
                WHERE DATETIME_TRUNC(created_datetime, DAY) = '{{ reference_time | format_date('%Y-%m-%d') }}'
            """,
            reader = BigQueryReader(json_credentials_path='/path/to/creds.json')
        )
        ```
        
        The `query` parameter is a templated query where you can format the `reference_time` `datetime` object to the required format using template filters.
        
        The `reader` parameter is the object that is actually going to connect to the desired database and perform the queries.
        
        The `metric` object can now be used to fetch metrics for a given point in time as follows:
        
        ```python
        result = metric.fetch(reference_time=datetime.date(2019, 10, 21))
        ```
        
        The result is returned as a list of dictionaries.
        
        ### Template filters
        
        [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.10.x/) is used as the templating engine. All built in Jinja filters are thus available. Relevant custom template filters have been added though for convenience:
        
        #### format_date
        
        Specify format of datetime:
        
        ```
        '{{ reference_time | format_date('%Y-%m-%d') }}'
        ```
        
        #### day_delta
        
        Change a given datetime object by a specified number of days:
        
        ```
        '{{ reference_time | day_delta(-7) | format_date('%Y-%m-%d') }}'
        ```
        
        ### Readers
        
        Any reader will implement the following method that is used to execute queries:
        
        ```python
        def execute(self, query) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
            ...
        ```
        
        #### BigQueryReader
        
        The underlying client is required to be authenticated with the necessary priviledges to read from the requested BigQuery tables.
        
        If you authenticate with:
        
        ```bash
        gcloud auth login
        ```
        
        or
        
        ```bash
        export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/keyfile.json"
        ```
        
        then you can just instantiate your `Reader` like this:
        
        ```python
        reader = BigQueryReader()
        ```
        
        The other option is to explicitly authenticate with a service account key file:
        
        ```python
        reader = BigQueryReader(json_credentials_path='/path/to/creds.json')
        ```
        
        #### HiveReader
