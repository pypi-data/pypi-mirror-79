## Overview

Current Version: **0.1.1**

The Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) has a treasure trove of business data available to indviduals
for free. However, the biggest obstacle to getting this free data boils down to two challenges:

1. Figuring out where it is
2. Figuring out how to extract it

The Python SEC library (`pysec`) is designed to make the collection and the extraction of SEC data quick
and effortless. The library was designed around some of the following goals:

1. Making the usage of the EDGAR search system, in a prgorammatic fashion, more intuitive.
2. Making the definition of queries more customizeable while still maintaining the overall clearity
   of the library.
3. Standardize the returning content so that content is organized consistently and ensuring gaps in data
   are filled in or extended that way navigating to other directories or files can be done dynamically.
4. Simplify the parsing of XBRL files so that data can be more easily manipulated.

## Setup

**Setup - PyPi Install:**

To **install** the library, run the following command from the terminal.

```console
pip install python-sec
```

**Setup - PyPi Upgrade:**

To **upgrade** the library, run the following command from the terminal.

```console
pip install --upgrade python-sec
```

**Setup - Local Install:**

If you are planning to make modifications to this project or you would like to access it
before it has been indexed on `PyPi`. I would recommend you either install this project
in `editable` mode or do a `local install`. For those of you, who want to make modifications
to this project. I would recommend you install the library in `editable` mode.

If you want to install the library in `editable` mode, make sure to run the `setup.py`
file, so you can install any dependencies you may need. To run the `setup.py` file,
run the following command in your terminal.

```console
pip install -e .
```

If you don't plan to make any modifications to the project but still want to use it across
your different projects, then do a local install.

```console
pip install .
```

This will install all the dependencies listed in the `setup.py` file. Once done
you can use the library wherever you want.

## Usage

Here is a simple example of using the `pysec` library to grab the index files for specific quarter.

```python
import pprint
from pysec.edgar import EDGARQuery

# Initialize the client.
edgar_client = EDGARQuery()

# Grab a specific Quarterly Archive Indexes.
quarterly_archives = edgar_client.get_quarterly_index(year=2000, quarter=4)
pprint.pprint(quarterly_archives)
```

You will note the output of the above code would look like the following:

```json
[
  {
    "href": "company.gz",
    "last_modified": "09/06/2014 01:08:55 AM",
    "name": "company.gz",
    "size": "1287 KB",
    "type": "file",
    "url": "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/full-index/2000/QTR4/company.gz"
  },
  {
    "href": "company.idx",
    "last_modified": "09/06/2014 01:08:53 AM",
    "name": "company.idx",
    "size": "10625 KB",
    "type": "file",
    "url": "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/full-index/2000/QTR4/company.idx"
  }
]
```
