Description: =================================
        SageMaker MXNet Inference Toolkit
        =================================
        
        SageMaker MXNet Inference Toolkit is an open-source library for serving MXNet models on Amazon SageMaker.
        This library provides default pre-processing, predict and postprocessing for certain MXNet model types and
        utilizes the `SageMaker Inference Toolkit <https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-inference-toolkit>`__
        for starting up the model server, which is responsible for handling inference requests.
        
        For training, see `SageMaker MXNet Training Toolkit <https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-mxnet-training-toolkit>`__.
        
        For the Dockerfiles used for building SageMaker MXNet Containers, see `AWS Deep Learning Containers <https://github.com/aws/deep-learning-containers>`__.
        
        For information on using MXNet on Amazon SageMaker, please refer to the `SageMaker Python SDK documentation <https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-python-sdk>`__.
