Punpy stands for "Propagating UNcertainties with PYthon". This is a **preliminary** tool to propagate random, structured and systematic uncertainties and calculate covariance/correlation matrices through a given measurement function. It is under development by the ECO group of the UK National Physical Labaratory. It currently uses a Monte Carlo approach, with other methods to follow.
