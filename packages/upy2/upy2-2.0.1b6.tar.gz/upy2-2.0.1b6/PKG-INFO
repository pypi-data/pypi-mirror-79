Description: Measurements are precise only up to a particular *uncertainty*.
        Such measurement results are thus called *uncertain quantities*.  When
        performing calculations with uncertain quantities, the uncertainties
        of the results depend on the uncertainties of the operands involved.
        The quantification of uncertainties resulting from a mathematical
        operation involving uncertain operands is called *uncertainty
        propagation*.
        From a programmer's point of view, uncertainties might be associated
        with the respective nominal values, such that the propagation of
        uncertainties happens automatically, and existing algorithms can be
        re-used with the *uncertain quantities* as arguments.
        Here I am proposing a Python package to define uncertain operands, to
        carry out calculations using such operands *with uncertainty
        propagation*, and to provide string representations of uncertain
        quantities involved.
        Complex numbers can be used to define uncertain quantities; for such
        complex-valued uncertainties no net uncertainty can be calculated.
        The objects holding uncertain values have array properties, though
        scalar arrays can be used; elements of an uncertain array behave as if
        they were uncertain quantities on their own.  When requesting a string
        representation of an uncertain quantity, the typeset result depends on
        the number of standard deviations to use and on the chosen precision,
        given by the number of digits with respect to the uncertainty.
        Furthermore, when typesetting multidimensional arrays with
        uncertainty, the decimal fractions are aligned to improve readability
        of the results.
        ``upy`` uses *algorithmic differentiation* (also known as *automatic
        differentation*) to track uncertainties through the operations.
        Uncertain values might be used in calculations together with other
        uncertain values as well as with any numeric Python or ``numpy``
        objects.  A range of mathematical functions is supported.
        ``upy`` provides several syntactic conventions appropriate to the
        subject.  For instance, defining uncertain quantities is possible by
        writing:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            uvalue = nominal +- u(uncertainty)
        
        where ``u`` is a function provided by ``upy``.  Uncertain values
        constructed in this way will be independent of each other with respect
        to their uncertainties; ``upy`` will keep track of the correlations
        arising from combination of uncertain quantities in mathematical
        operations.  All functionality is suited both for use in the
        interactive Python shell as well as in programs for numerical
        analysis.
