Description: # niced_url_request
        
        A simple wrapper class to "nice" url requests in python by setting a maximum frequency to url requests, and using a disk cache.
        
        ## Motivation
        
        I have needed several times lately to get some relatively large dataset from the net as a series of smaller http requests. This class is a convenient small wrapper for doing so without annoying the server.
        
        ## Functionalities
        
        - limit request rate
        - cache the answers on disk
        - perform up to 10 re-tries waiting 10 seconds in between if request fails to make querying large quantities of requests robust to minor network / service interruptions
        
        ## Installation
        
        ```
        pip install niced_url_request
        ```
        
        ## Tests and example
        
        To run tests: ```pytest -v .``` from the present folder.
        
        For a detailed example: see ```examples``` folder.
        
        Small start up example:
        
        ```
        from niced_url_request import NicedUrlRequest
        
        niced_requester = NicedUrlRequest()
        
        request_result = niced_requester.perform_request("http://httpbin.org/get?bla1=blabla1")
        
        print(request_result.decode("ASCII"))
        ```
