    A configurable limit on the number of file descriptors that can be opened
    by a rootwrap-started process has been added. It defaults to 1024, but
    can be adjusted by setting the ``rlimit_nofile`` option in rootwrap.conf
    to a larger or smaller value.
upgrade:
  - |
    Because a file descriptor limit was added in this release (see the features
    section for details), rootwrap processes that were previously relying on
    inheriting their parent process's descriptor limits may exhaust their
    available file descriptors. Use the ``rlimit_nofile`` option to restore
    the previous limits if this is the case.
