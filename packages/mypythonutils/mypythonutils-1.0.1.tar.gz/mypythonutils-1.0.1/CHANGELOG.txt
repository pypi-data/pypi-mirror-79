Change Log
=================

1.0 (26/08/2020)
-----------------
* First Release :

    - Function showlist : takes a list and prints it into the console.

    - Function squareroot : outputs the square root of the number you give.

    - Function listprimes : lists every prime up to the number you give.


1.0.1 (11/09/2020)
------------------
* Additions :
    
    - Class primes :
        
        Function isprime : outputs True if the number you gave it is prime.
        
    - Class math :
        
        Function absolute : an alternative to the "abs" function in python.
        
    - Class logic :
        
        Function logicand, logicnand, logicor, logicnor, logicxor, logicnot : these are logic gates. They take 2 booleans (1 for logicnot) and output a boolean. All these functions are branchless !
        
    - Class lists :
        
        More in the "Modifications" paragraph


* Modifications :
    
    - Class primes :
        
        The "listprimes" function is here now. You can now also set a starting point for the listing but it is optional.
    
    - Class math :
        
        The "squareroot" function is here now and it's called "root" because you can now specify if you want the square root, the cubic root...
        It is optional so by default it outputs the square root.
        
    - Class lists:
        
        The "showlist" function is now here and it's name is now "show" because it is already in a list class !
    

I will maybe change the way it is organized, but I don't think it will change the way everything behaves.
