        PURPOSE
        -------
        
        This implement faster divmod() (and mod()) for moduli with trailing 0 bits.
        
        INSTALLATION
        ------------
        
        pip3 install shift_divmod
        
        USAGE
        -----
        
        ::
        
            from shift_divmod import ShiftDivMod
        
            base = 997
            shift = 1200
            modder = ShiftDivMod(base, shift)
            # Or use:
            # modder = ShiftDivMod.from_int(base << shift)
        
            # same as divmod(x, (base << shift))
            print( modder.divmod(x) )
        
        NOTES
        -----
        
        This was proposed as a proof-of-concept for
        a potential improvement for the built in cpython3
        operations here: https://bugs.python.org/issue41487 but was
        rejected.
