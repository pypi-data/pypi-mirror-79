Installation
============

Hardware control requires python â‰¥ 3.6.

The code is available on `PyPi <https://pypi.org/project/hardware-control>`_ and therefore can be installed using pip.


To install *hardware_control* use pip::

  pip install hardware_control

Or use the *-U* flag to update the package::

  pip install -U hardware_control


If you want to also work on the code, e.g. add new instruments or supply bug fixes, you can clone the code from bitbucket using::

  git clone https://bitbucket.org/berkeleylab/hardware-control.git

and then cd into the repository and use::

  pip install -e .

In case you create new files in the repo, you will need to rerun the last command.
