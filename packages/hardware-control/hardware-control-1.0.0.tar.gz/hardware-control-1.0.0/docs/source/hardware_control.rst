Hardware control reference
==========================

The hardware control package consists of several classes that define
the main functionality, e.g. a Qt-app and main window, classes to
start a thread that will communicate with an instrument, several
Qt-widgets that come in handy, for example, for plotting data and then
backend drivers for different hardware and their Qt-frontends. Some
hardware share the same Qt-frontend.

The package is split into two parts:
