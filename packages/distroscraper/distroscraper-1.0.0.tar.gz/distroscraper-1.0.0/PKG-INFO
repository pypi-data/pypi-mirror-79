Description: distroscraper
        =============
        
        Scrapes Linux distribution web pages for new torrent files and adds
        them to Transmission.  I want to give back to the Free Software
        community and one way I can do that is by seeding their torrents.
        
        For legitimate redistrbution of permitted content only.
        
        Included are scrapers for these distributions:
        * Arch Linux
        * Debian
        * Fedora
        * Linux Mint
        * Raspberry Pi
        
        Would love to include, if they would provide a _legitimate_ torrent:
        * OPNsense
        
        If your favorite distribution is not mentioned, you can open an
        issue, or contribute a pull request.  Take a look at the other
        files in /distroscraper/scrape and make it look like those in general.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Create and configura a Python Virtual Environment for distroscraper:
        
        ```bash
        python -m venv /home/myser/.venv_distroscraper
        . /home/myuser/.venv_distroscraper/bin/activate
        pip install distroscraper
        ```
        
        Use scrape-and-add.sh.dist from this repository or from this README
        file to create your own scrape-and-add.sh.  You will also need the
        'jq' command line json processing tool.
        
        ```bash
        #!/bin/bash
                  
        VENV_PATH=/path/to/venv
        DISTROS="distroscraper.scrape.archlinux
                 distroscraper.scrape.debian
                 distroscraper.scrape.fedora
                 distroscraper.scrape.linuxmint
                 distroscraper.scrape.raspberrypi"
        TM_ARGS="--host localhost
                 --port 9091
                 --user myuser
                 --password supersecret
                 --download-dir /path/to/linuxdownloads"
        
        for d in $DISTROS; do
          $VENV_PATH/bin/python -m $d | \
            jq .href | \
            xargs $VENV_PATH/bin/python -m distroscraper.tm_add_torrent $TM_ARGS
        ```
        
        Create a systemd timer or cron job to run scrape-and-add.sh periodically.
        Transmission is smart enough not to add the same torrent multiple times.
        
        Reporting
        ---------
        
        If you want to ingest transmissions stats into some logging solution
        like ELK or Graylog, you can use this which will produce some JSON
        that can be massaged into these systems:
        
        ```bash
        python -m distroscraper.tm_get_stats
        ```
