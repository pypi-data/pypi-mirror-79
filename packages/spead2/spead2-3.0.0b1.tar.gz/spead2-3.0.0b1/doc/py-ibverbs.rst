Support for ibverbs
===================
Receiver performance can be significantly improved by using the Infiniband
Verbs API instead of the BSD sockets API. This is currently only tested on
Linux with Mellanox ConnectX®-3 and ConnectX®-5 NICs. It depends on device
managed flow steering (DMFS).

There are a number of limitations in the current implementation:

 - Only IPv4 is supported.
 - VLAN tagging, IP optional headers, and IP fragmentation are not supported.
 - For sending, only multicast is supported.

Within these limitations, it is quite easy to take advantage of this faster
code path. The main difficulties are that one *must* specify the IP address of
the interface that will send or receive the packets, and that the
``CAP_NET_RAW`` capability may be needed. The netifaces_ module can
help find the IP address for an interface by name.

System configuration
--------------------

ConnectX®-3
^^^^^^^^^^^
Add the following to :file:`/etc/modprobe.d/mlnx.conf`::

   options ib_uverbs disable_raw_qp_enforcement=1
   options mlx4_core fast_drop=1
   options mlx4_core log_num_mgm_entry_size=-1

.. note::

   Setting ``log_num_mgm_entry_size`` to -7 instead of -1 will activate faster
   static device-managed flow steering. This has some limitations (refer to the
   manual_ for details), but can improve performance when capturing a large
   number of multicast groups.

   .. _manual: http://www.mellanox.com/related-docs/prod_software/Mellanox_EN_for_Linux_User_Manual_v4_3.pdf

ConnectX®-4+, MLNX OFED up to 4.9
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Add the following to :file:`/etc/modprobe.d/mlnx.conf`::

   options ib_uverbs disable_raw_qp_enforcement=1

All other cases
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
No system configuration is needed, but the ``CAP_NET_RAW`` capability is
required. Running as root will achieve this; a full discussion of Linux
capabilities is beyond the scope of this manual.
For more information, see the `libvma documentation`_. For ConnectX®-4/5, only
the first of these lines is required.

Receiving
---------
The ibverbs API can be used programmatically by using an extra method of
:py:class:`spead2.recv.Stream`.

.. py:method:: spead2.recv.Stream.add_udp_ibv_reader(endpoints, interface_address, max_size=DEFAULT_UDP_IBV_MAX_SIZE, buffer_size=DEFAULT_UDP_IBV_BUFFER_SIZE, comp_vector=0, max_poll=DEFAULT_UDP_IBV_MAX_POLL)

      Feed data from multicast IPv4 traffic. For backwards compatibility, one
      can also pass a single address and port as two separate arguments in
      place of `endpoints`.

      :param list endpoints: List of 2-tuples, each containing a
        hostname/IP address and the UDP port number. The address may be either
        unicast or multicast, but in the former case there must be
        an interface with that IP address (usually it will be the same as
        `interface_address`, but this is not required as an interface may have
        multiple IP addresses).
      :param str interface_address: Hostname/IP address of the interface which
        will be subscribed
      :param int max_size: Maximum packet size that will be accepted
      :param int buffer_size: Requested memory allocation for work requests.
        It may be adjusted due to implementation-dependent limits or alignment
        requirements.
      :param int comp_vector: Completion channel vector (interrupt)
        for asynchronous operation, or
        a negative value to poll continuously. Polling
        should not be used if there are other users of the
        thread pool. If a non-negative value is provided, it
        is taken modulo the number of available completion
        vectors. This allows a number of readers to be
        assigned sequential completion vectors and have them
        load-balanced, without concern for the number
        available.
      :param int max_poll: Maximum number of times to poll in a row, without
        waiting for an interrupt (if `comp_vector` is
        non-negative) or letting other code run on the
        thread (if `comp_vector` is negative).

If supported by the NIC and the drivers, the receive code will automatically
use a "multi-packet receive queue", which allows each packet to consume only
the amount of space needed in the buffer. This is currently only supported on
ConnectX®-4+ with MLNX OFED drivers prior to 5.0. When in use, the
`max_size` parameter has little impact on performance, and is used only to
reject larger packets.

When multi-packet receive queues are not supported, performance can be
improved by making `max_size` as small as possible for the intended data
stream. This will increase the number of packets that can be buffered (because
the buffer is divided into fixed-size slots), and also improve memory
efficiency by keeping data more-or-less contiguous.

Environment variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
An existing application can be forced to use ibverbs for all IPv4
readers, by setting the environment variable :envvar:`SPEAD2_IBV_INTERFACE` to the IP
address of the interface to receive the packets. Note that calls to
:py:meth:`spead2.recv.Stream.add_udp_reader` that pass an explicit interface
will use that interface, overriding :envvar:`SPEAD2_IBV_INTERFACE`; in this case,
:envvar:`SPEAD2_IBV_INTERFACE` serves only to enable the override.

It is also possible to specify :envvar:`SPEAD2_IBV_COMP_VECTOR` to override the
completion channel vector from the default.

Note that this environment variable currently has no effect on senders.

Sending
-------
Sending is done by using the class :py:class:`spead2.send.UdpIbvStream` instead
of :py:class:`spead2.send.UdpStream`. It has a different constructor, but the
same methods. There is also a :py:class:`spead2.send.asyncio.UdpIbvStream`
class, analogous to :py:class:`spead2.send.asyncio.UdpStream`.

.. py:class:: spead2.send.UdpIbvStream(thread_pool, multicast_group, port, config, interface_address, buffer_size, ttl=1, comp_vector=0, max_poll=DEFAULT_MAX_POLL)

   Create a multicast IPv4 UDP stream using the ibverbs API

   :param thread_pool: Thread pool handling the I/O
   :type thread_pool: :py:class:`spead2.ThreadPool`
   :param str multicast_group: Multicast group hostname/IP address
   :param int port: Destination port
   :param config: Stream configuration
   :type config: :py:class:`spead2.send.StreamConfig`
   :param str interface_address: Hostname/IP address of the interface which
     will be subscribed
   :param int buffer_size: Socket buffer size. A warning is logged if this
     size cannot be set due to OS limits.
   :param int ttl: Multicast TTL
   :param int buffer_size: Requested memory allocation for work requests.
   :param int comp_vector: Completion channel vector (interrupt)
     for asynchronous operation, or
     a negative value to poll continuously. Polling
     should not be used if there are other users of the
     thread pool. If a non-negative value is provided, it
     is taken modulo the number of available completion
     vectors. This allows a number of streams to be
     assigned sequential completion vectors and have them
     load-balanced, without concern for the number
     available.
   :param int max_poll: Maximum number of times to poll in a row, without
     waiting for an interrupt (if `comp_vector` is
     non-negative) or letting other code run on the
     thread (if `comp_vector` is negative).
