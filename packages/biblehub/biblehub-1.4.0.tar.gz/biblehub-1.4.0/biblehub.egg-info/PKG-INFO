Description: # BibleHubScrapper
        A python module that retrieve a single verse and the information on it from biblehub.com.
        Also a simple commandline application
        
        ## Installation
        ```pip3 install BibleHubScrapper```
        
        ## Commandline
        To retrieve all the currently available information on a reference, use the '-a' tag:
        
        `biblehub -a [Reference]`
        
        To only retrieve specific information, pass in the corresponding tag:
        ```
        biblehub -c [Reference] # Also retrieves the cross-references
        biblehub -t [Reference] # Also retrieves the lexicon
        ```
        As with most cli tools, arguments can be stacked with one hyphen, such as:
        ```
        biblehub -cl [Reference] # Retrieves the cross-references and lexicon in addition to the passage
        ```
        ## Script Usage
        You can import the query method to use in scripts.
        ```
        from BibleHubScrapper import query
        
        biblehub_query = query('Genesis 1:1')
        print(biblehub_query.text) # In the beginning...
        ```
        By default, it will query all possible fields.
        You can choose not to query certain fields by indicating in the parameters
        for example:
        ` query('Genesis 1:1', get_lexicons=False) `
        
        ## Useful fields
        ```
        print(biblehub_query.passage) # Genesis 1:1
        print(biblehub_query.version) # NIV (default)
        print(biblehub_query.lexicons) # Text, Hebrew words, translit, strong, and English defintions
        print(biblehub_query.crfs) # Cross References
        print(biblehub_query.tos) # Treasury of Scripture
        print(biblehub_query.info) # Prints all the info queried on the verse. Also the same as the __str__
        ```
        there are also `biblehub_query.format_[field]` method that returns the specified field in an easy to read way.
