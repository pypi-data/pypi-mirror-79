Thank you also to everyone who has helped via email, in discussions
on GitHub, and on `software underground <https://swung.slack.com>`__!

Your help is very welcome! No contribution is too small. You can help with the
documentation, adding example notebooks, posting ideas or feature requests to
GitHub, or by working on the code - or anything else!

Places you can help
----------------------------

* Please don’t hesitate to open a
  `GitHub issue <https://github.com/kinverarity1/lasio/issues/new>`__
  for any problems you are having with lasio, or any ideas for improvements.

* Please feel free to contribute suggested changes. The easiest method is to
  fork lasio on GitHub and
  `submit a pull request <https://github.com/kinverarity1/lasio/pulls>`__
  against the "master" branch. Don’t worry about getting all the details right,
  either way it’s still the most convenient way for me or other maintainers to
  see your changes in context.

* Example LAS files: if you have an
  interesting/difficult/silly/standards-challenged LAS file (any version) you
  would be willing to share with me, please do so! Email it to me at
  `kinverarity@hotmail.com <kinverarity@hotmail.com>`__. The more examples we can
  incorporate into lasio’s regression testing, the better. If you have concerns
  about privacy, I’d suggest obfuscating with find-and-replace on various alpha
  (or numeric) characters before sending it on, and/or deleting any sensitive header
  lines.

Code of Conduct
---------------------------

Our Pledge
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age,
body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of
experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual
identity and orientation.

Our Standards
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention
  or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

Our Responsibilities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Scope
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an
appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a
project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

Enforcement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at kinverarity@hotmail.com. The
project team will review and investigate all complaints, and will respond in a
way that it deems appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obliged to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an
incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted
separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.

Attribution
