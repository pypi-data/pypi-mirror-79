# JazzIt ðŸŽ·

Ever wanted your scripts to play music while running/ on erroring out ?

Of course you didn't

But here it is anyway


### What it do ?

With `Jazzit` you can just add a decorator to your functions and jazz it up 

- You can have a elevator music to go along with your long running script
- Let your script play a humiliating music when it errors out    

There are default tracks you can use, or you can use your own custom tracks

### How to do it ?

Play Frolic from curb your enthusiasm to keep you in your place

```python
from jazzit import error_track

@error_track("curb_your_enthusiasm.mp3", wait=7)
def run():
    for num in reversed(range(10)):
        print(10/num)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    run()

```

Sip coffee to elevator music while your scripts is running

```python

from jazzit import waiting_track

def fibonacci(n):
    if n < 0:
        raise Exception("BE POSITIVE !!!")
    elif n == 1:
        return 0
    elif n == 2:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)

@waiting_track("elevator.mp3")
def run(limit):
    for num in range(1, limit):
        print(fibonacci(num))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    run(1000)
``` 

The in-build tracks are bruh_moment, elevator and curb_your_enthusiasm but you can add your custom tracks
