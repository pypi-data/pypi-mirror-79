Description: # JazzIt ðŸŽ·
        
        Ever wanted your scripts to play music while running/ on erroring out ?
        
        Of course you didn't
        
        But here it is anyway
        
        
        ### Install
        
        ```
        pip install jazzit
        ```
        
        ### What it do ?
        
        With `Jazzit` you can just add a decorator to your functions and jazz it up 
        
        - You can have a elevator music to go along with your long running script
        - Play humiliating music when it errors out to put you in your place
        
        There are default tracks you can use, or you can use your own custom tracks
        
        ### How to do it ?
        
        Play Frolic from curb your enthusiasm to keep you in your place
        
        ```python
        from jazzit import error_track
        
        @error_track("curb_your_enthusiasm.mp3", wait=7)
        def run():
            for num in reversed(range(10)):
                print(10/num)
        
        if __name__ == "__main__":
            run()
        
        ```
        
        Sip coffee to elevator music while your script is running
        
        ```python
        
        from jazzit import waiting_track
        
        def fibonacci(n):
            if n < 0:
                raise Exception("BE POSITIVE !!!")
            elif n == 1:
                return 0
            elif n == 2:
                return 1
            else:
                return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)
        
        @waiting_track("elevator.mp3")
        def run(limit):
            for num in range(1, limit):
                print(fibonacci(num))
        
        if __name__ == "__main__":
            run(1000)
        ``` 
        
        The in-build tracks are bruh_moment, elevator and curb_your_enthusiasm but you can add your custom tracks 
        
        
        Check out some of the [examples](https://github.com/Sangarshanan/jazzit/examples)
        
        
        > :warning: **Use wisely**:  Best suited for scripts you run for non-professionally !
        
        
        ### Dependencies
        
        Jazz added with [playsound](https://github.com/TaylorSMarks/playsound)
        
        If you are ubuntu and getting hit with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'gi`
        
        You might need to install Pygobject https://pygobject.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html
        
        
        ### Profiling
        
        
        I did a lil profiling on bin/profiler.py
        
        > Without Music
        
        Time to run : 5.2486350536346436 secs
        
        > With Music
        
        Time to run: 5.270173072814941 secs
        
        Memory profiling `python -m memory_profiler bin/profiler.py`
        
        
        ### Disclaimer
        
        Default tracks were pulled from https://www.youtube.com/user/gamingsoundfx/
        
        No Copyright Infringement Intended
        
        I might take down these tracks or add more depending on the number of lawsuits I get slapped with
