# knora-py
knora-py is a python package containing a command line tool for data model (ontology) creation, a library allowing creation of single resources and mass upload using the bulk import of data into the Knora framework.

The package consists of:
- `dsplib` Python modules for accessing Knora using the API (ontology creation, data import/export etc.)
- `knora-create-onto` A command line program to create an ontology out of a simple JSON description
- `knora-reset-triplestore` A command line program to reset the content of the ontology. Does not require
   a restart of the Knora-Stack.

[pypi] 
repository = https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/ 
username =your_username_on_pypi
```

then upload:

```bash
$ make upload

```bash
$ pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
```

### Running tests with Bazel

Run all tests:
```bash
$ bazel test //...
```

Run single test:
```bash
$ bazel test //test:test_knora
```
