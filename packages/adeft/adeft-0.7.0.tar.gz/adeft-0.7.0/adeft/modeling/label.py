        corpus : list of tuple
            Contains tuples for each text in the input list which contains
            a defining pattern. Multiple tuples correspond to texts with

            defining patterns replaced with only the shortform. The second
            element contains the groundings for longforms matched with a
            defining pattern.

            Returns None if no label can be found by matching the standard
            pattern. Otherwise, returns a list of pairs containing the training
            text and a label for each label appearing in the input text
