Description: 
            Sitka is a built environment analysis and modeling library for Python.
        
            This library is intended to make modeling and simulation for the built environment more hackable and easier to use for:
        
            * Portable design tools
            * Scalable web apps and services
            * Quick design and analysis studies
            * Interactive simulations and analyses
            * Testing new models
        
            The library is currently being written entirely in Python using [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) as a core dependency in order to allow easier integration with data analysis in [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org).
        
            A focus of this project is to create tools to make building models more hackable.  The library can be used to create a simple model just a few inputs or a larger whole building model can be created by connecting multiple objects.
