sphinxcontrib-direct-copy
=========================

A sphinx extension to copy files directly from the source directory to the target
directory. 

Overview
--------

In some cases files are referred from raw html sections in .md documents. These files
need to be copied from the source directory to the target directory. 
Most common examples are images which are scaled in some way. As this is a nonexistent
feature in Markdown most of the document use raw html img tags.
