Tool to extract the function definitions from the source code

It can be used to extract functions from,

- C  

- C++

- C#  

- Java  

- Python

- TypeScript

- JavaScript

Advantage of using such function extractions are,

- Resolving technical debt  

- Identify function similarity  

- Identify pattern check (Supresswarnings, Assert, etc...)
  
## Dependencies

- python 3.8 : 64 bit  

- python packages (xlrd, xlsxwriter, pandas)  

- third party packages [Ctags, grep]

## Installation
  
[INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md)

```sh
pip install functiondefextractor
```

## Usage & Configuration

### Code

- General usage with out options.

```sh
from functiondefextractor import core_extractor
out_put = core_extractor.extractor (r"path_to_repo/code")
print(out_put)
```

- To exclude specific files from repository.

```sh
from functiondefextractor import core_extractor
out_put = core_extractor.extractor (r"path_to_repo/code", exclude=r'*\test\*,*.java')
print(out_put)
```

Sample regex patterns:
Note: Space given after comma(,) in regex pattern is also treated as part of
the pattern. For example

```sh
(*.java, *.cpp) != (*.java,*.cpp)
```

```sh
1. '*.java' =>  to exclude all java files in a repository.

2. '*/test/*' => to exclude test folder and files in it.

3. '*/src/*/*.cpp' => to exclude all cpp files in src and it's sub directories
```

- To extract functions based on annotation.

```sh
from functiondefextractor import core_extractor
out_put = core_extractor.extractor (r"path_to_repo/code", annot="@Test")
print(out_put)
```

- To extract delta lines(+/-) from code based on annotation/key word.
Note: If user is unaware of complete annotation use this(annot with delta)
feature to extract functions else use the above feature. Suggested to use
delta=0 to get only line with annotation.

```sh
from functiondefextractor import core_extractor
out_put = core_extractor.extractor(r"path_to_repo/code", annot="@SupressWarning", delta="5")
print(out_put)
```

- To analyse various patterns in the code based on given condition.
For example to search assert, suppress warnings patterns.

```sh
from functiondefextractor import condition_checker
out_put = core_extractor.check_condition("@SupressWarning", r"path_to_excelfile/dataframe", "(")
print(out_put[0], out_put[1])
```

### Commandline

- General usage with out options to extract functions from repo.

```sh
>>>python -m functiondefextractor --p "path/to/repo"
```

- To extract functions from repo having specific annotation.

```sh
>>>python -m functiondefextractor --p "path/to/repo" --a "@SuppressWarnings(\"UnusedReturnValue\")"
```

Note: If annotation contains double quotes as part of annotation(like
above example) use backslash(\) before double quote inside annotation.

- To ignore files from repo using regex pattern.

```sh
>>>python -m functiondefextractor --p "path/to/repo" --i '*.java, *.cpp'
```

- To analyse various patterns in the code based on given condition.

```sh
>>>python -m functiondefextractor --c "Assert" --e "path/to/excel" --s "("
```

- Help option can be found at,  

```sh
>>>python -m functiondefextractor --h
```

### Sample use cases

- To extract all functions from a repository

```sh
>>>python -m functiondefextractor --p "path/to/repo"
```

```sh
from functiondefextractor import core_extractor
out_put = core_extractor.extractor (r"path_to_repo/code")
print(out_put)
```

- To extract all functions with "@Test" annotation
  excluding all ".cpp" files in the repository

```sh
>>>python -m functiondefextractor --p "path/to/repo" --a "@Test" --i '*.cpp'
```
  
```sh
from functiondefextractor import core_extractor
out_put = core_extractor.extractor(r"path_to_repo/code", annot="@Test", exclude=r'*.cpp')
print(out_put)
```

Note:

1. functionstartwith argument can be used to specifically extract code
from required functions whose names starts with "test_" or what ever name
user is interested in.

2. delta and annot arguments together can be used to extract required number
of lines below and above the given annotation/keyword.

- To analyze various patterns present in extracted code

```sh
>>>python -m functiondefextractor --c "Assert" --e "path/to/excel" --s "("
```

```sh
from functiondefextractor import condition_checker
out_put = core_extractor.check_condition("@SupressWarning", r"path_to_excelfile/dataframe", "(")
print(out_put[0], out_put[1])
```

### Output
  
- Executing functiondefextractor to extract functions from
 command line would generate an output excel file which contains
 FileName_FunctionName in Unique ID column and extracted functions in Code column

- Using functiondefextractor to extract functions from code would return
 a dataframe with same content as excel file.

- When functiondefextractor is executed from script to analyse patterns in code,
 a tuple with 2 data frames would be generated which contains the requested pattern
 statements with their count in various functions and a pivot table of the
 same respectively.
