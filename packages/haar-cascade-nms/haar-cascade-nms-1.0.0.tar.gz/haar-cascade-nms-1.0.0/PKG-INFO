Description: # OpenCV Haar cascade with Non-Maxima Suppression
        This simple project provides a `Detector` class extending the opencv `CascadeDetector`class with a new function: `detectAndFilter`.  
        This function performs the detection using the cascade and filter the detections based on the score and their overlap to yield the best detections that do not overlap above the selected `overlap-threshold`.
        
        For more details about Non-Maxima Supression, you can refer to my article about Multi-Template Matching, which uses a similar strategy (or other online ressources).  
        Here the NMS shipped with OpenCV is used.
        
        # Installation
        Using pip:  
        `pip install haar-cascade-nms`
        
        Then to use in your scripts:  
        ```python
        from haarcascade import Detector
        myDetector = Detector(filepathToCascade)
        myDetector.detectAndFilter(image, etc...)
        ```
        
        See the tutorial notebook for a more detailled documentation.
