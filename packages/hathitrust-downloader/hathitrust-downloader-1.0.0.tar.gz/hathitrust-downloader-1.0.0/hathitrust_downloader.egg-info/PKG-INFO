Description: # HathiTrust Downloader
        [![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/hathitrust-downloader?style=flat-square)](https://pypi.org/project/hathitrust-downloader/)
        
        ## Installing
        
        ### Python 3 (OS Agnostic)
        
        Check that you have Python 3 installed and available on your shell. The following command should return something like `Python 3.8.5`.
        
        ```bash
        python -V
        ```
        
        > Windows users: Make sure to enable the "Add to PATH" option when installing Python.
        
        Now you can install using `pip` with the following command.
        
        ```bash
        pip install hathitrust-downloader
        ```
        
        Which allows you to interact with the downloader from the command line:
        
        ```bash
        hathitrust-downloader --help
        ```
        
        ### Windows Executable
        
        There are also Windows executables available. Download the `downloader.zip` from [releases](https://github.com/Addono/HathiTrust-downloader/releases/) and extract it. Then open a shell, e.g. `cmd` or `powershell`, to the directory where the ZIP is extracted. The easiest way to do this is by opening the folder in Explorer and right click while holding shift, now select the option "Open PowerShell Window Here".
        
        The executable is bundled with Python and all other dependencies, hence you do not need to have anything installed. Now the tool can be used like:
        
        ```powershell
        .\downloader.exe --help 
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        The help should give some instructions on how to use the tool:
        
        ```bash
        usage: hathitrust-downloader [-h] [--name NAME] id start_page end_page
        
        Book downloader from Hathitrust
        
        positional arguments:
          id           The ID of the book, e.g 'mdp.39015027794331'.
          start_page   The page number of the first page to be downloaded.
          end_page     The last number of the last page to be downloaded (inclusive).
        
        optional arguments:
          -h, --help   show this help message and exit
          --name NAME  The start of the filename. Defaults to using the id. This can
        ```
        
        One example which downloads page 1 until (and including) 10 of the book with id `mdp.39015027794331` and naming the files `my-book_page_<page_number>.pdf`:
        
        ```bash
        python downloader.py mdp.39015027794331 1 10 --name my-book
        ```
        
        The ID of the file can be found as part of the URL when opening a book through your browser.
        
        ## Troubleshooting
        
        ### No Progess / Progress Bar is Stuck
        
        Make sure that you can access books on HathiTrust. Try to open a book in your browser to see if everything is working fine. HathiTrust can require you to connect from an American IP. In addition, they limit the amount of pages you can download to 15 every 5 minutes. When you hit that limit you will need to wait, the tool will automatically wait and resume when the timeout is finished.
