0.5.0
-----

* Extended some of the fitresult tests, and not without succes since we immidiately found an inconsistency with basinhopping
* Reduce if/for/else complexity some more
* Fix the failing ODE warnings. Due to the fact that we are now more strict about users always having to provide values to variables, an error is already raised for non-ODE models containing derivatives

* Improver automatic selection of the objective by partially binding the data first instead of fully binding as before
* Changed to pytest.warns, removed unittest2 as a dependence
* Fixed parameter sorting in TakesData so interactiveguess works again
* Removed outdated skipped tests, still related to NumericalLeastSquares
* A whole sway of small test improvements

* Use assertWarns in tests. Requires the package unittest2 for py27
* Added a warning if users provide a model with derivative operators in it which is not an ODEModel

* SymPy added better printing for MatPow, but this broke our sqrt of a (1, 1) matrix scalar. Fixed by checking the shape before taking the power, and take a standard power if we're dealing with a scalar
* Because equility of FitResults is ill-defined, I decided to remove that for now but leave a working definition intact which can be used for testing only
* Set up build stages
* Fix insidious typo
* Revert "Make interactive guess tests use Agg backend"
