        ![Pipeline Status](https://gitlab.com/alexandre-perrin1/jenkins-lockable-resources/badges/master/pipeline.svg)
        
        ## About the library
        
        This library and CLI utility was developped to access and control
        [Jenkins Lockable-Resources plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/lockable-resources/)
        because the current version of the plugin does not provide REST APIs.
        
        ## Prerequisite
        
        As python2 is on its way to be deprecated, this tool was designed for python3
        only.
        
        The command line interface has been written with click package.
        An optionnal `click-completion` package can also be installed in order to give
        shell completion feature.
        
        ## Install
        
        The tool may be installed from sources with pip package manager from PyPi.
        
        ```
        pip3 install jenkins-lockable-resources
        ```
        
        ## Testing
        
        This package is tested using `pytest` framework. See `requirements-test.txt` for the
        list of required packages.
        
        Install requirements for testing:
        
        ```
        pip3 install -r requirements-test.txt
        ```
        
        The tests are held in `tests` directory.
        Simply execute pytest from command line:
        
        ```
        pytest tests
        ```
        
        ## Development
        
        For development, install as editable:
        
        ```
        pip3 install -e .
        ```
