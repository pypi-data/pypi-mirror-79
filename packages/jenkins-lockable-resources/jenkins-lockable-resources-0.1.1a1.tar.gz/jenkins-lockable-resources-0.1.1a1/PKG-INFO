        ![Pipeline Status](https://gitlab.com/alexandre-perrin1/jenkins-lockable-resources/badges/master/pipeline.svg)
        
        ## About the library
        
        This library and CLI utility was developped to access and control
        [Jenkins Lockable-Resources plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/lockable-resources/)
        because the current version of the plugin does not provide REST APIs.
        
        ## Prerequisite
        
        As python2 is on its way to be deprecated, this tool was designed for python3
        only.
        
        The command line interface has been written with click package and all commands
        are designed as click plugins, wich requires click-plugins contrib package.
        An optionnal `click-completion` package can also be installed in order to give
        shell completion feature.
        
        ## Install
        
        The tool may be installed from sources with pip package manager from PyPi.
        
        ```
        pip3 install jenkins-lockable-resources
        ```
        
        ## Testing
        
        This package is tested using `pytest` framework. See `requirements-test.txt` for the
        list of required packages.
        
        Install requirements for testing:
        
        ```
        pip3 install -r requirements-test.txt
        ```
        
        The tests are held in `tests` directory.
        Simply execute pytest from command line:
        
        ```
        pytest tests
        ```
        
        ## Development
        
        For development, install as editable:
        
        ```
        pip3 install -e .
