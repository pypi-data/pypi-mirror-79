Description: # This is the set of python3 scripts used to perform some checks on GCP Project Resources to improve security
        -------------
        
        This script is worked for individual GCP project not on organization or folder level
        
        package installation
            
            install package using 
            pip3 install gcpsecurity
        
        How to use ??
        
            step 1: Import classes to perform checks
                
                from gcpsecurity.gcp_vm import ExecuteCheckVm
                from gcpsecurity.gcp_iam import ExecuteCheckIam
                from gcpsecurity.gcp_vpc import ExecuteCheckVpc
                from gcpsecurity.gcp_gcs import ExecuteCheckGcs
                from gcpsecurity.gcp_cloud_sql import ExecuteCheckSql
                    
            step 2: Create GCP service account with project viewer permission
            step 3: Initlize ExecuteCheck class with service account file path and project id
                    
                    vm = ExecuteCheckVm(servive_account_file_path=SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE_PATH, project_id=PROJECT_ID)
                    vpc = ExecuteCheckVpc(servive_account_file_path=SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE_PATH, project_id=PROJECT_ID)
                    iam = ExecuteCheckIam(servive_account_file_path=SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE_PATH, project_id=PROJECT_ID)
                    gcs = ExecuteCheckGcs(servive_account_file_path=SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE_PATH, project_id=PROJECT_ID)
                    sql = ExecuteCheckSql(servive_account_file_path=SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE_PATH, project_id=PROJECT_ID)
            
            step 4: Call perform_check() method of ExecuteCheck classes object
            
                    vm_result = vm.perform_check()
                    vpc_result = vpc.perform_check()
                    iam_result = iam.perform_check()
                    gcs_result = gcs.perform_check()
                    sql_result = sql.perform_check()
            
            step 5: Print results
                    
                    print(vm_result)
                    print(vpc_result)
                    print(iam_result)
                    print(gcs_result)
                    print(sql_result)
                      
            
         
        ** Note:- service account file should have appropriate permissions to perform checks 
        That is Project Viewer (You can set permissions as per service also)
        
        ** Note :-Script might take time to execute because it is make googleapis calls
