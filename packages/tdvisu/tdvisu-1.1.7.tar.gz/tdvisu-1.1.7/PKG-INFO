        ----------
        
        Visualization for [dynamic programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming) on [tree decompositions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_decomposition).
        
        Create a graph object for each given graph that is of interest for the dynamic programming.
        
        The visualization generates highlights and adds solution-tables for user defined time steps.
        
        These snapshot of the graphs will be written in a graphviz-supported file-format to a folder of your choosing.
        
        For the portable and light weight '.svg' format, all graphs for a timestep can be joined together to provide a thoroughly view on the process of dynamic programming.
        
        With the '.svg' format the images are highly customizable, and even combining several timesteps together using svg [animate](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/animate) would be an option in the future.

        # Using

        [for dpdb: psycopg2 (2.8.5)](https://www.psycopg.org/docs/index.html)
        
        ----------
        
        # To register the graphviz plugins
        https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/issues/1352
        ```shell
        dot.exe -c
        ```
        
        # To install
        
        In a command prompt with pip (to get *pip* see: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) installed:
        Just run
        ```shell
        pip install -h (for more information on install options)
        pip install tdvisu
        ```
        
        To download the latest version from the default branch:
        ```shell
        git clone --depth 1 --single https://github.com/VaeterchenFrost/tdvisu
        ```
        
        # To isolate the dependencies
        
        With [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/installation.html ) on the system installed you can isolate the environment, for example
        ```shell
        virtualenv tdvisu_dir -p 3.8
        cd tdvisu_dir/bin/
        source activate
        ```
        With [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) on the system installed the dependencies for this project can be automatically installed in a new environment:
        
        Go to the projects base directory.
        
        Open a *conda-command-prompt* with admin privileges and run the commands from the project folder
        - to create a new environment with basic dependencies:
        ```shell
        conda env create -f .\environment.yml
        ```
        - to activate the environment:
        ```shell
        conda activate tdvisu
        ```
        
        # Install from source
        
        To clone the complete repository:
        ```shell
        git clone https://github.com/VaeterchenFrost/tdvisu
        ```
        
        To download only the latest version from the default branch:
        ```shell
        git clone --depth 1 --single https://github.com/VaeterchenFrost/tdvisu
        ```
        
        To install the project from the source folder:
        ```shell
        pip install -h (for more information on install options)
        pip install .
        ```
        to confirm that the visualization finds all dependencies:
        ```shell
        python .\tdvisu\visualization.py -h
        ```
        to run all tests:
        ```shell
        pip install .[test] 
        pytest .\test\
        ```
        
        ----------
        
        # How to use
        
        The visualization needs input in the form of the [Json API](https://github.com/VaeterchenFrost/gpusat-VISU/blob/master/JsonAPI_v1.3.md).
        The creation of this file is exemplary implemented in *construct_dpdb_visu.py* or the fork [GPUSAT](https://github.com/VaeterchenFrost/GPUSAT) and *--visufile filename* (optionally disabling preprocessing with *-p*).
        
        Run the python file with the above dependencies installed:
        [visualization.py](https://github.com/VaeterchenFrost/gpusat-VISU/blob/master/satvisualization_repo/satvisu/visualization.py)
        
        **visualization.py** takes two parameters, the json-**infile** to read from, and optionally one **outputfolder**.
        With both arguments a call from IPython might look like this:
        
        ```python
        runfile('visualization.py', 
        args='visugpusat.json examplefolder')
        ```
        
        For #SAT it produces for example three different graphs suffixed with a running integer to represent timesteps:
        
        + *TDStep* the tree decomposition with solved nodes
        + *PrimalGraphStep* the primal graph with currently active variables highlighted
        + *IncidenceGraphStep* the bipartite incidence graph with active clauses/variables highlighted
        
        The graphs are images encoded in resolution independent **.svg files** (see https://www.lifewire.com/svg-file-4120603)

        ## How to use construct_dpdb_visu.py
        After installing the project [dp_on_dbs](https://github.com/hmarkus/dp_on_dbs) with the there listed [requirements](https://github.com/hmarkus/dp_on_dbs#requirements), we need to
        - edit the [database.ini](https://github.com/VaeterchenFrost/tdvisu/blob/master/tdvisu/database.ini) with our password to [postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org/)
        - Solve a problem with `python dpdb.py [GENERAL-OPTIONS] -f <INPUT-FILE> <PROBLEM> [PROBLEM-SPECIFIC-OPTIONS]`
          - for the problem **VertexCover** 
            - with flag `--gr-file` to store the htd Input (if the input was in a different format)
          - for the problem **SharpSat**
            - with flag `--store-formula` to store the formula in the database
        - Run 
          - **Sat** / **SharpSat**: `python construct_dpdb_visu.py [PROBLEMNUMBER]`
          - **VertexCover**: `python construct_dpdb_visu.py [PROBLEMNUMBER] --twfile [TWFILE]` 
           with the file in DIMACS tw-format containing the edges of the graph.
        
        # Installation of the psycopg2 package 
        
        See https://www.psycopg.org/docs/install.html#build-prerequisites
        
        For example on linux today this might need
        `sudo apt install libpq-dev` 
        before completion.
