Description: # mOTUlizer
        Utility to analyse a group of closely related MAgs/Genomes/bins/SUBs of more or less dubious origin
        
        ## INSTALL
        
        ```
        pip install mOTUlizer
        ```
        
        
        ## USAGE
        
        ### EASY
        
        To make OTUs and get some stats, needs fastANI in the `PATH`, and output of checkm
        
        ```
        mOTUlize.py -k checkm_output.txt  --output a_messy_json-file_with_the_output.json
        ```
        
        Loads of little options if you do : `mOTUlize.py -h`
        
        Also there is `mOTUpan.py` that can compute core genomes and pangenomes. Needs to be more debugged so try  out at own risk:
        
        ```
        mOTUpan.py -h
        ```
