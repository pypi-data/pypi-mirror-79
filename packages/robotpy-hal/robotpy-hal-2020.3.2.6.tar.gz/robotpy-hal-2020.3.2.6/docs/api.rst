HAL API
-------

The WPILib Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) is used by WPILib to interact
with robot devices in a platform independent way.

Generally, RobotPy users should avoid interacting with the HAL directly
except for the HAL simulation objects. The HAL simulation objects can
be used to interact with your devices in simulation, and also display
things on the simulation GUI.
