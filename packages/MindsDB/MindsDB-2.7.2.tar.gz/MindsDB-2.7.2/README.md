MindsDB is an Explainable AutoML framework for developers built on top of Pytorch. It enables you to build, train and test state of the art ML models in as simple as one line of code.

### Installation


* **Desktop**: You can use MindsDB on your own computer in under a minute, if you already have a python environment setup, just run the following command:

```bash
 pip install mindsdb --user
```

>Note: Python 64 bit version is required. Depending on your environment, you might have to use `pip3` instead of `pip` in the above command.*

  If for some reason this fail, don't worry, simply follow the [complete installation instructions](https://docs.mindsdb.com/Installing/) which will lead you through a more thorough procedure which should fix most issues.

* **Docker**: If you would like to run it all in a container simply:  

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mindsdb/mindsdb/master/distributions/docker/build-docker.sh)"
```


### Usage

Once you have MindsDB installed, you can use it as follows:

Import **MindsDB**:

```python

from mindsdb import Predictor

```

One line of code to **train a model**:

```python
# tell mindsDB what we want to learn and from what data
Predictor(name='home_rentals_price').learn(
    to_predict='rental_price', # the column we want to learn to predict given all the data in the file
    from_data="https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/mindsdb-example-data/home_rentals.csv" # the path to the file where we can learn from, (note: can be url)
)

```


One line of code to **use the model**:

```python

# use the model to make predictions
result = Predictor(name='home_rentals_price').predict(when_data={'number_of_rooms': 2, 'initial_price': 2000, 'number_of_bathrooms':1, 'sqft': 1190})

# you can now print the results
print('The predicted price is between ${price} with {conf} confidence'.format(price=result[0].explanation['rental_price']['confidence_interval'], conf=result[0].explanation['rental_price']['confidence']))

```

## MindsDB Lightwood: Machine Learning Lego Blocks

Under the hood of mindsdb there is lightwood, a Pytorch based framework that breaks down machine learning problems into smaller blocks that can be glued together seamlessly. More info about [MindsDB lightwood's on GITHUB](https://github.com/mindsdb/lightwood/).

## Contributing

In order to make changes to mindsdb, the ideal approach is to fork the repository than clone the fork locally `PYTHONPATH`.

For example: `export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/home/my_username/mindsdb`.

Too test your changes you can run unit tests (fast) and CI tests (slightly longer) locally.

To run the unit tests:
* Install pytest: `pip install -r requirements_test.txt`
* Run: `pytest`

To run the CI tests: `cd tests/ci_tests && python3 full_test.py`

Once you have specific changes you want to merge into master, feel free to make a PR.

Due to some repository restructuring the "old" Mindsdb repository is now Mindsdb Native (https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb_native). This repository is the "old" Mindsdb Server repository, though from a user's perspective everything should work just the same.

Thanks for Max Stepanov (@StpMax) , Zoran Pandovski (@ZoranPandovski), Jorge Torres(@torrmal) for their contributions to Mindsdb Server, even though their contributions to those particular components may not show up in the commit history.

## Running mindsdb as a developer

1. Make your you have python3 and pip3 installed (one some environments pip3 might be called pip instead, if you don't have the `pip3` command just run `pip --version` and if it says something with `(python 3.x)` in there that means you can use that). The version of python3 should be > 3.4.

2. If you already installed mindsdb via pip uninstall it and all related mindsdb packages by running:

`pip3 uninstall mindsdb; pip3 uninstall mindsdb_native; pip3 uninstall lightwood; sudo pip3 uninstall mindsdb; sudo pip3 uninstall mindsdb_native; sudo pip3 uninstall lightwood;`

That should get rid of all local versions of mindsdb you have.

3. Pick a directory (here I'll call it `/home/my_user` and clone the repository you want to use there).

For mindsdb this would be `git clone git@github.com:mindsdb/mindsdb.git`
For native: `git clone git@github.com:mindsdb/mindsdb_native.git`
For lightwood: `git clone git@github.com:mindsdb/lightwood.git`

4. Install everything in the `requirements.txt` files of the project.

For mindsdb this would be `cd mindsdb && pip3 install -r requirements.txt --user`

5. Add the projects you want to use to your `PYTHONPATH` env variable by running:

`export PYTHONPATH=/home/my_user/mindsdb` (replace `mindsdb` with `mindsdb_native` and `lightwood` for those packages)

If you want to use multiple projects at once you can add `:` between the directories to pythonpath, e.g.

`export PYTHONPATH=/home/my_user/mindsdb_native:/home/my_user/lightwood:/home/my_user/mindsdb`

Add that same `export` command in a new line at the end of your `~/.bashrc` files to have this exported when the computer boots up in all terminals.

6. Note, when running a script importing these libraries or running them as a python module (e.g. `python3 -m mindsdb`) make sure you are in a directory other than `/home/my_user` or `/home/my_user/package_name` (where `package_name` is mindsdb, lightwood or mindsdb_native). Otherwise the python importer will fail to properly import them

7. If you want to install a version of mindsdb, lightwood ... etc from pip, do it in a virtualenv where you run `export PYTHONPATH=''`, otherwise the `PYTHONPATH` exports will override the version installed via pip
