    """Uncompress and extract the source tar archive as a directory as the named destination path.

    This function extracts the (possibly compressed) tar archive, specified by :param:`src_archive`,
    and writes its contents as a directory, specified by :param:`dest_dir`.

    The read mode is determined by the :param:`src_archive`'s filename extension. If no known compression
    extension is found ('gz', 'bz2', and 'xz'), then :func:`tarfile.open`'s "transparent read mode" is
    used.

    To override this path-dependant behavior, :param:`compression_ext` may be supplied as the exact
    read mode variant to use in the underlying :func:`tarfile.open` call. Valid compression schemes are:
      - 'gz'
      - 'bz2'
      - 'xz'
    By default, the :param:`src_archive` filename extension is inspected to determine the compression schema.

    The :param:`overwrite` parameter controls whether or not the destination directory is removed before
    extraction, if present. By default, this function will fail with a `ValueError` if the destination
    is already a file or directory.

    WARNING: SIDE EFFECT: Changes local disk contents.

    :raises IOError If source archive is not a file.
    :raises ValueError If destination is occupied and overwrite is false.
    :raises Exception On problems during tar file extraction and decompression.
