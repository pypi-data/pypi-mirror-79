Jupytab Server allows you to **explore in Tableau data which is generated
dynamically by a Jupyter Notebook**. You can thus create Tableau data
sources in a very flexible way using all the power of Python.
This is achieved by having Tableau access data through a **web
server created by Jupytab**.

Jupytab Server is built on **solid foundations**: Tableau's Web Data
Connector and the Jupyter Kernel Gateway.

Features:

* **Expose multiple pandas dataframes** to Tableau from a Jupyter
  notebook
* Access **several notebooks** from Tableau through a **single
  entry point** (web server)
* Manage your notebooks using a **web interface**
* **Secure access** to your data

The full documentation is available on the project's home page.
