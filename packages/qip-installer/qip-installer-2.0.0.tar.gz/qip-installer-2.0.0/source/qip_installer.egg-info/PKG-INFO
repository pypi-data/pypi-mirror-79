Description: ###
        Qip
        ###
        
        Qip is a Quarantine Installer for Python built over `Pip <https://pip.pypa.io>`_
        and `Wiz <https://wiz.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html>`_.
        
        It uses `Pip <https://pip.pypa.io>`_ commands to query and install Python
        packages with its dependencies to specific locations in an isolated manner.
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            >>> qip install scipy
            info: Requested 'scipy'
            info: 	Installed 'scipy-1.5.2'.
            info: 	Wiz definition created for 'scipy-1.5.2'.
            info: Requested 'numpy>=1.14.5' [from 'scipy-1.5.2'].
            info: 	Installed 'numpy-1.19.2'.
            info: 	Wiz definition created for 'numpy-1.19.2'.
            info: Packages installed: numpy-1.19.2, scipy-1.5.2
            info: Package output directory: '/tmp/qip/packages'
            info: Definition output directory: '/tmp/qip/definitions'
        
        A `Wiz <https://wiz.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html>`_ definition is created
        for each package installed in order to safely use it within a protected
        environment.
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            >>> wiz -add /tmp/qip/definitions use scipy -- python
