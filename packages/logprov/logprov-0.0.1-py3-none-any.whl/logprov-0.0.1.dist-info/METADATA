# logprov

This package provides functions to automatically capture provenance information into a structured log file. 
It tracks entities that are used and generated by activities such as Python functions or class methods, 
recording also the activity parameters and the execution environment.

Additional functions help to convert the structured logs into IVOA/W3C Provenance file formats or graphs.
