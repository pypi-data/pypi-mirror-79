        This package allows your users to download Plone content as PDF files. As admin
        you can define specific PDF themes per content-type.
        
        .. note ::
        
          Requires `wkhtmltopdf`_ system-package installed on your server.
          See `eea.converter`_ documentation for more details.

        Install
        =======
        
        - Add eea.pdf to your **eggs** and **zcml** section in your buildout
          and re-run buildout.
          You can download a sample buildout from
          https://github.com/eea/eea.pdf/tree/master/buildouts/plone4
        - Install eea.pdf within Site Setup > Add-ons
        
        ::
        
            [instance]
            eggs =
                ...
                eea.pdf
        
            zcml =
                ...
                eea.pdf
        
        
        External PDF generator tools
        ----------------------------
        Ensure that you have installed `wkhtmltopdf`_ on your machine. You
        can also install `wkhtmltopdf`_ from buildout::
        
            [buildout]
        
            parts +=
                wkhtmltopdf
        
            [wkhtmltopdf]
            recipe = hexagonit.recipe.download
            url = http://eggrepo.apps.eea.europa.eu/pypi/wkhtmltopdf/wkhtmltopdf-0.12.1.tgz
        
            [instance]
            environment-vars +=
                WKHTMLTOPDF_PATH ${wkhtmltopdf:location}/wkhtmltopdf
        
        Asynchronous setup
        ------------------
        By default all PDFs are generated asynchronous, therefore some extra config is
        needed within your buildout in order for this to work properly.
        
        First of all you'll need a folder were to store generated PDF files. For this
        you can create it manually within buildout:directory/var/ or you can let buildout
        handle it::
        
            [buildout]
        
            parts +=
                media-downloads
                media-downloads-temp
        
        
            media-downloads-path = ${buildout:directory}/var/downloads/pdf
            media-downloads-temp = ${buildout:directory}/var/downloads/tmp
        
            [media-downloads]
            recipe = ore.recipe.fs:mkdir
            path = ${buildout:media-downloads-path}
            mode = 0700
            createpath = true
        
            [media-downloads-temp]
            recipe = ore.recipe.fs:mkdir
            path = ${buildout:media-downloads-temp}
            mode = 0700
            createpath = true
        
        This will create a folder named **downloads** within buildout:directory/var/
        
        Next, in order for this folder to be visible from your website and your users to
        be able to download generated PDFs you'll need to tell to your zope instances
        about it::
        
            [buildout]
        
            media-downloads-name = downloads
            media-downloads-path = ${buildout:directory}/var/downloads/pdf
            media-downloads-temp = ${buildout:directory}/var/downloads/tmp
        
            [instance]
        
            environment-vars +=
                EEADOWNLOADS_NAME ${buildout:media-downloads-name}
                EEADOWNLOADS_PATH ${buildout:media-downloads-path}
                EEACONVERTER_TEMP ${buildout:media-downloads-temp}
        
        Also, don't forget to setup `plone.app.async`_
        
        ::
        
            [buildout]
        
            [instance]
            eggs +=
                plone.app.async
            zcml +=
                plone.app.async-single_db_worker

        Content rules

        Plone > Site Setup > Content-rules
        
        .. warning ::
        
          As these content-rules are triggered by an asynchronous job, while
          you customize the email template for these content-rules,
          please **DO NOT USE OTHER** string substitutions **that the ones** that start
          with **$download_** as you'll break the download chain.
          Also if you disable these content-rules the users will never know when the
          PDF is ready and what is the link where they can download the output PDF.
        
        Export succeeded
        ----------------
        Notify the person who requested a PDF export that the PDF successfully exported

        ${download_type}
        ----------------
        Download type. Default to PDF for this package. It is package specific and it
        can be PDF, EPUB, etc.
        
        
        Disable PDF export
        ==================
        You have the possibility to temporarily disable dynamic PDF export contextually
        by adding a static PDF file (or a Python Script, Page Template, etc)
        within context called **action-download-pdf**. This way /download.pdf will
        return this file instead of generating one based on context data.
        
        .. note::
        
          This works only with folderish items.
        
        Troubleshooting
        ===============
        PDFs are generated asynchronously using a parallel zc.async queue.quota.
        The number of workers that will generate PDFs in parallel is automatically
        calculated based on the number of zeo-clients registered with
        **plone.app.async-*_db_worker**.
        
        As every **db_worker** can handle simultaneously **maximum 3 jobs** (hard-coded in zc.async Agent),
        if you have **2 workers** then the maximum number of PDFs that will be generated
        at the same time will be **6** (2 workers * 3). Same if you have **5**, you'll get
        **15 PDFs** generated at the same time.
        
        If for any reason you don't want them to be generated simultaneously you can set
        environment variable **EEAPDF_ASYNC_THREADS** to **1** within buildout::
        
            [buildout]
        
            ...
        
            [instance]
        
            ...
        
            environment-vars +=
                EEAPDF_ASYNC_THREADS 1
        
        
        Also, if you experience issues by having too many simultaneously PDF jobs, you
        can limit them in the same way as above.
