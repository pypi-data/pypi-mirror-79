Description: 
        camd is software designed to support Computational Autonomy for Materials Discovery
        based on ongoing work led by the
        [Toyota Research Institute](http://www.tri.global/accelerated-materials-design-and-discovery/).
        
        camd enables the construction of sequential learning pipelines using a set of
        abstractions that include
        * Agents - decision making entities which select experiments to run from pre-determined
            candidate sets
        * Experiments - experimental procedures which augment candidate data in a way that
            facilitates further experiment selection
        * Analyzers - Post-processing procedures which frame experimental results in the context
            of candidate or seed datasets
        
        In addition to these abstractions, camd provides a loop construct which executes
        the sequence of hypothesize-experiment-analyze by the Agent, Experiment, and Analyzer,
        respectively.  Simulations of agent performance can also be conducted using
        after the fact sampling of known data.
