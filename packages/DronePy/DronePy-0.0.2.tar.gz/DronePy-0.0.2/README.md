# DronePy
Open Source Drone Command Library

The purpose of this library is to provide hobbyists with an interface to connect specific drone models with their own equipment. A nice sample sample drone you can buy is the DX-2, and you can use the LimeSDR as the equipment.

## What DronePy Will Do

DronePy will allow a programmer to select their drone model, and their preferred SDR, and send comands to their drone in real time.

It is being considered whether to add functionality to sample signals and auto-generate models.
