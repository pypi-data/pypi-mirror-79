        DAX: Distributed Automation for XNAT
        ========================================================
        
        *DAX*, is  a python package developed at Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN,
        USA. It's available on github at the address: https://github.com/VUIIS/dax.
        See the different tutorials bellow to learn more about this package and how
        to use it.
        
        XNAT gives an incredible flexible imaging informatics software platform to
        organise, manage any imaging data. It also provides a Pipeline Engine to run
        processings on your data. The pipeline engines has an important learning curve
        and doesn't provide a way to run processes when your XNAT instance isn't
        connected to your cluster.
        
        *DAX*, an open-source initiative under the umbrella of Vanderbilt University
        Institute of Imaging Science (VUIIS), is a Python project that provides a
        uniform interface to run pipelines on a cluster by grabbing data from a XNAT
        database via RESTApi Calls.
        
        *DAX* allows you to:
        
        * extract information from XNAT via scripts (bin/Xnat_tools/Xnat...)
        * create pipelines (spiders/processors) to run pipelines on your data
        * build a project on XNAT with pipelines (assessors)
        * launch pipelines on your cluster and upload results back to xnat
        * interact with XNAT via python using commands in XnatUtils.
