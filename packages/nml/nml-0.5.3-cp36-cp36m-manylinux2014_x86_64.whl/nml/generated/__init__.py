# This package may contain the parsetab.py and lextab.py
#  files generated by PLY to speed up parser initialization.
#
# DO NOT EDIT THEM
#
# PLY will attempt to generate them at runtime if they aren't
#  present or the NML grammar/tokens have changed.
#
# The setup.py script should generate them at build time.
