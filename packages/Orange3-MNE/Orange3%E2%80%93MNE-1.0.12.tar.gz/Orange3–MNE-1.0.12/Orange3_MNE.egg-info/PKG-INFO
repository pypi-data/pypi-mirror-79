Description: ## MNE Widgets for Orange 3 (Orange3-MNE)
        Orange3-MNE is a python package, that provides methods from MNE for Python for Orange 3 in a form of widgets, 
        to allow for electrophysiological data processing.
        
        > *Note: This library was created as a part of the master's thesis to show that it is possible to use Orange 3 as a workflow management system for electrophysiological data processing. The widgets' functionality was verified on three existing experiments. Nevertheless, the library requires further development.* 
        
        ### Installation
        The installation process is quite straightforward, first we need to install the Orange 3 tool:
        > *Note: If you have Orange 3 already installed, you can skip this step.*
        ```bash
            virtualenv orange          # Create a virtual environment
            ./orange/Scripts/activate  # Activate the environment (source ./orange/Scripts/activate for linux)
            pip install Orange3 PyQt5  # Install Orange 3 and PyQt library
        ```
        
        Then it is possible to install the library using one of the following methods.
        
        
        ##### Pip Method
        ```bash
           pip install Orange3-MNE
        ```
        
        ##### GUI Method
        1. Run Orange: `python -m Orange.canvas`
        2. In Orange navigate to Options -> Add-ons
        3. Click on `Add more...` and enter the package name: `Orange3-MNE`
        4. Confirm the settings and Orange will install the library
        5. Restart Orange and the electrophysiological data processing library will be available
        
        ### User's guide
        The documentation on how to use Orange 3 is available on its [homepage](https://orange.biolab.si/docs/).
        
        The documentation to widgets in this library can be found [here](https://fifal.gitlab.io/orange-mne-library/), and [here](https://gitlab.com/fifal/orange-mne-library/-/blob/master/docs/widgets.md).
