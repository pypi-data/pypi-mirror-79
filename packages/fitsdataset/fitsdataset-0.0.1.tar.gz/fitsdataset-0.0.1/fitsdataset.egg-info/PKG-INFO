Description: FITSDataset
        ===
        
        This package contains a custom PyTorch Dataset for quick and easy training on FITS files, commonly used in astronomical data analysis. In particular, the `FITSDataset` class caches FITS files as PyTorch tensors for the purpose of increasing training speed.

        ## Quickstart
        Using Python 3.6+, install from source with
        ```bash
        python -m pip install git+https://github.com/amritrau/fitsdataset.git
        ```
        
        Create a toy dataset with samples from the
        [Hyper Suprime-Cam survey](https://www.naoj.org/Projects/HSC/) with:
        ```python
        >>> from fitsdataset import FITSDataset
        >>> dataset = FITSDataset("path/to/examples/hsc/", size=101, label_col="target")
        ```
        
        Notice that the cached tensors appear in `path/to/examples/hsc/tensors`.
