Description: mBuild: A hierarchical, component based molecule builder
        
        With just a few lines of mBuild code, you can assemble reusable components into
        complex molecular systems for molecular dynamics simulations. mBuild is
        designed to minimize or even eliminate the need to explicitly translate and
        orient components when building systems: you simply tell it to connect two
        pieces! mBuild also keeps track of the system's topology so you don't have to
        worry about manually defining bonds when constructing chemically bonded
        structures from smaller components.
