    """ Adds label smoothing regularisation to C.cross_entropy_with_softmax

    Label smoothing regularisation prevents the largest logit from becoming much larger than all others.

    Classical cross entropy maximises log-likelihood of the correct label. This can cause overfitting.
    If the model learns to assign full probability to the ground-truth label for each training example, it
    is not guaranteed to generalize. Second, it encourages the differences between the largest logit and all others to
    become large, and this, combined with the bounded gradient, reduces the ability of the model to adapt.
    Intuitively, this happens because the model becomes too confident about its predictions.

    To solve this, we introduce label smoothing.

    By introducing robustness as a continuous parameter, our loss function allows algorithms

    basic vision tasks such as registration and clustering.

    The approximate form of the loss which is faster to compute, but inaccurate
    when the difference between `output_vector` and `target_vector`  and alpha are near zero.

    Different alpha allows you to get various forms of robust loss:
        alpha = 2: L2 loss
        alpha = 1: pseudo-Huber loss
        alpha = 0: Cauchy loss
        alpha = -2: Geman-McClure loss
        alpha = -inf: Welsch loss

    The effect of outlier diminishes as alpha becomes more negative, and as alpha approaches -inf an
    outlier whose residual magnitude is larger than 3 * scale is almost completely ignored.

    This generalised loss for all alpha has the following properties:
        Monotonic (useful for annealing)
        Smooth wrt inputs and alpha
        Bounded first and second derivatives

    Note:
        this is NOT the adaptive implementation of barron loss, which is slightly more complicated to implement,
        since it uses cubic spline interpolation to estimate the partition function.

        I may implement it once i have time.

        output_vector: tensor (assumes last axis is the dimension axis where the loss is to be computed from)

          negative, and as alpha approaches -inf an outlier whose residual magnitude is larger than 3 * scale
          is almost completely ignored.
        scale (float): controls the size of the loss's quadratic bowl near x = 0, the derivative of the loss is
          approximately linear when |x| < scale. If scale is set as None, it will be learned.
