Description: # ngChat Speech to Text and Text to Speech SDK
        
        ### Welcome to ngChat, Next Generation Chat, a revolutionary enterprise conversational platform that aims to:
        
        1. addressing issues from the first version of NLU/ChatFlow, and
        2. adding significant new features that support enterprise dialogue applications for the next 5 years.
        
        ### To know more, please visit [Seasalt.ai](https://seasalt.ai/)
        
        ## Example to use ngChat Speech to Text SDK:
        
        ### Prerequisites
        You'll need a ngchat speech-to-text server url to run this example. Please contact Seasalt.ai to have one.
        
        ### Install and import the Speech SDK
        First you'll need to install the Speech SDK.
        
        ```pip install ngchat-speech-sdk```
        
        After the Speech SDK is installed, import it inot your Python project with this.
        
        ```import ngchat_speech.speech as speechsdk```
        
        ### Create a speech configuration
        To call the Speech service using the Speech SDK, you need to create a SpeechConfig.
        You'll need a ngchat speech-to-text server url to run this example. Please contact Seasalt.ai to have one.
        ```
            speech_config = speechsdk.SpeechConfig(
                host="ws://NGCHAT_STT_SERVER/client/ws/speech"
            )
        ```
        
        ### Recognize from a file
        In this example, we'll show how to recognize speech from an audio file, if you want to recognize a stream, you'll need to use SpeechRecognizer.start_continuous_recognition_async() instead of SpeechRecognizer.recognize_once().
        Create an AudioConfig and use the `filename` parameter.
        ```
            audio_stream = speechsdk.audio.PushAudioInputStream()
            audio_config = speechsdk.audio.AudioConfig(
                filename="test.wav"
            )
        ```
        
        ### Initialize a recognizer
        After you've created a SpeechConfig and an AudioConfig, the next step is to initialize a SpeechRecognizer.
        ```
            speech_recognizer = speechsdk.SpeechRecognizer(
                speech_config=speech_config,
                audio_config=audio_config
            )
        ```
        
        ### Connect callbacks to recognizer
        SpeechRecognizer has 5 kinds of callbacks.
        - Recognizing - called when some words were recognized, but not finished recognizing a single utterance.
        - Recognized - called when a single utterance was recognized.
        - Canceled - called when a continuous recognition was interrupted.
        - Session_started - called when a recognition sesstion was started.
        - Session_stopped - called when a recognition sesstion was stopped.
        ```
            speech_recognizer.recognizing.connect(
                lambda evt: print(f"Recognizing: {evt.result.text}"))
            speech_recognizer.recognized.connect(
                lambda evt: print(f'Recognized: {evt.result.text}'))
            speech_recognizer.canceled.connect(
                lambda evt: print(f'Canceled: {evt}'))
            speech_recognizer.session_started.connect(
                lambda evt: print(f'Session_started: {evt}'))
            speech_recognizer.session_stopped.connect(
                lambda evt: print(f'Session_stopped: {evt}'))
        ```
        
        ### Recognize speech
        Now you're ready to run SpeechRecognizer. SpeechRecognizer has two ways for speech recognition.
        - Single-shot recognition - Performs recognition once. This is to recognize a single audio file. Stop recognizing after a single utterance is recognized.
        - Continuous recognition (async) - Asynchronously initiates continuous recognition operation. Connect to Recognizing and Recognized callbacks to receive recognition results. To stop asynchronous continuous recognition, call stop_continuous_recognition_async().
        
        ```speech_recognizer.recognize_once()```
        
        ### Put all together
        We put all these steps together, the example code to test ngChat Speech SDK will look like this.
        ```
        import speech as speechsdk
        import audio as audio
        import asyncio
        import threading
        import sys
        import time
        
        if __name__=="__main__":
            # this is an example to show how to use the ngChat Speech SDK to recognize once
        
            try:
                speech_config = speechsdk.SpeechConfig(
                    host="ws://NGCHAT_STT_SERVER/client/ws/speech"
                )
                audio_stream = audio.PushAudioInputStream()
                audio_config = audio.AudioConfig(filename="test.wav")
                speech_recognizer = speechsdk.SpeechRecognizer(
                    speech_config=speech_config,
                    audio_config=audio_config
                )
        
                speech_recognizer.recognizing.connect(
                    lambda evt: print(f"Recognizing: {evt.result.text}"))
                speech_recognizer.recognized.connect(
                    lambda evt: print(f'Recognized: {evt.result.text}'))
                speech_recognizer.canceled.connect(
                    lambda evt: print(f'Canceled: {evt}'))
                speech_recognizer.session_started.connect(
                    lambda evt: print(f'Session_started: {evt}'))
                speech_recognizer.session_stopped.connect(
                    lambda evt: print(f'Session_stopped: {evt}'))
        
                speech_recognizer.recognize_once()
                time.sleep(3)
        
            except KeyboardInterrupt:
                print("Caught keyboard interrupt. Canceling tasks...")
            except Exception as e:
                print(f"Exception: {e}")
            finally:
                sys.exit()
        ```
