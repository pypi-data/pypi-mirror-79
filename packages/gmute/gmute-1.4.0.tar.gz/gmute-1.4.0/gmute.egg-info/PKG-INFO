Description: gmute adds support for Gmail's "mute" feature to mutt, and any other mail
        client which can output the raw headers to a file. Muting prevents new entries
        in a thread from appearing in the inbox, which can be very useful for managing
        mailing list activity.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        First, put your IMAP credentials in ``~/.config/gmute``, like so:
        
        ::
        
            [auth]
            user = jcd@unatco.int
            pass = bionicman
        
        If you want to use this from the mutt index, you can add something like the
        following binding to your configuration with gmute in mutt's $PATH:
        
        ::
        
            macro index M '<enter-command>set pipe_sep="\n_PIPE_SEP_\n"<enter><pipe-message>gmute<enter><sync-mailbox>'
        
        Then, with a message from a thread you want to mute highlighted in the index,
        press M to mute that thread, just as would work in the Gmail UI. gmute also
        works with tags, either using ``tag-prefix`` or ``set auto_tag``.
        
        You might also want to ``unset wait_key`` in your mutt config if you don't want
        the "press any key to continue" prompt.
