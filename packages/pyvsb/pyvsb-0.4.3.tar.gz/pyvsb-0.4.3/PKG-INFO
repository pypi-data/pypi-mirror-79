Description: PyVSB is a simple backup tool written in Python. It uses only standard file
        types such as plain text and tar archives for storing backed up files which is
        important because you always can easily restore particular files even if you
        don't have PyVSB or it doesn't work in your environment for some reason.
        
        PyVSB works only under Python 3. For Python 2 use PyVSB 0.2 which could be
        cloned here - https://github.com/KonishchevDmitry/pyvsb/tree/0.2
