=======
Filters
=======

Filters can be applied at either of two stages of processing:

* Applied to the downloaded data before storing it and diffing for changes (``filter``)
* Applied to the diff result before reporting the changes (``diff_filter``)

While creating your job pipeline, you might want to preview what the filtered output looks like. For filters applied
to the data, you can run `webchanges` with the ``--test-filter`` command-line option, passing in the index (from
``--list``) or the URL/command of the job to be tested::

   webchanges --test 1   # Test the first job in the list and show the data colleted after it's filtered
   webchanges --test https://example.net/  # Test the job that matches the given URL

This command will show the output that will be captured and stored, and used to compare to the old version stored from
a previous run against the same url or shell command.

Once `webchanges` has collected at least 2 historic snapshots of a job (two different states of a webpage) you can start
testing the effects of your ``diff_filter`` with the command-line option ``--test-diff``, passing in the index (from
``--list``) or the URL/command of the job to be tested, which using the historic data saved locally in the cache::

   webchanges --test-diff 1   # Test the first job in the list and show the report


At the moment, the following filters are available:

.. To convert the "webchanges --features" output, use:
   webchanges --features | sed -e 's/^  \* \(.*\) - \(.*\)$/- **\1**: \2/'

.. _css-and-xpath:

css and xpath
-------------

The ``css`` filter extracts content based on a `CSS selector <https://www.w3.org/TR/selectors/>`__. It uses the
`cssselect <https://pypi.org/project/cssselect/>`__ Python package, which has limitations and extensions as explained
in its `documentation <https://cssselect.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#supported-selectors>`__.

The ``xpath`` filter extracts content based on a `XPath <https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath>`__ expression.

Examples: to filter only the ``<body>`` element of the HTML document, stripping out everything else:

.. code-block:: yaml

   url: https://example.net/css.html
   filter:
     - css: ul#groceries > li.unchecked

.. code-block:: yaml

   url: https://example.net/xpath.html
   filter:
     - xpath: /html/body/marquee

See Microsoftâ€™s `XPath Examples <https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms256086(v=vs.110).aspx>`__ page for some
other examples

Using CSS and XPath filters with XML and exclusions
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

By default, CSS and XPath filters are set up for HTML documents, but it is possible to use them for XML documents as
well.

Example to parse an RSS feed and filter only the titles and publication dates:

.. code-block:: yaml

   url: https://example.com/blog/css-index.rss
   filter:
     - css:
         method: xml
         selector: 'item > title, item > pubDate'
     - html2text: re

.. code-block:: yaml

   url: https://example.com/blog/xpath-index.rss
   filter:
     - xpath:
         method: xml
         path: '//item/title/text()|//item/pubDate/text()'

To match an element in an `XML namespace <https://www.w3.org/TR/xml-names/>`__, use a namespace prefix before the tag
name. Use a ``|`` to seperate the namespace prefix and the tag name in a CSS selector, and use a ``:`` in an XPath
expression.

.. code-block:: yaml

   url: https://example.org/feed/css-namespace.xml
   filter:
     - css:
         method: xml
         selector: 'item > media|keywords'
         namespaces:
           media: http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/
     - html2text

.. code-block:: yaml

   url: https://example.net/feed/xpath-namespace.xml
   filter:
     - xpath:
         method: xml
         path: '//item/media:keywords/text()'
         namespaces:
           media: http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/


Alternatively, use the XPath expression ``//*[name()='<tag_name>']`` to bypass the namespace entirely.

Another useful option with XPath and CSS filters is ``exclude``. Elements selected by this ``exclude`` expression are
removed from the final result. For example, the following job will not have any ``<a>`` tag in its results:

.. code-block:: yaml

   url: https://example.org/css-exclude.html
   filter:
     - css:
         selector: 'body'
         exclude: 'a'

Limiting the returned items from a CSS Selector or XPath
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

If you only want to return a subset of the items returned by a CSS selector or XPath filter, you can use two additional
subfilters:

* ``skip``: How many elements to skip from the beginning (default: 0)
* ``maxitems``: How many elements to return at most (default: no limit)

For example, if the page has multiple elements, but you only want to select the second and third matching element (skip
the first, and return at most two elements), you can use this filter:

.. code:: yaml

   url: https://example.net/css-skip-maxitems.html
   filter:
     - css:
         selector: div.cpu
         skip: 1
         maxitems: 2

Duplicated results
""""""""""""""""""

If you get multiple results from one page, but you only expected one (e.g. because the page contains both a mobile and
desktop version in the same HTML document, and shows/hides one via CSS depending on the viewport size), you can use
'``maxitems: 1``' to only return the first item.


**Optional directives**
"""""""""""""""""""""""

* ``selector`` (for css) or ``path`` (for xpath) [can be entered as the value of the `xpath` or `css` directive]
* ``method``: Either of ``html`` (default) or ``xml``
* ``namespaces`` Mapping of XML namespaces for matching
* ``exclude``: Elements to remove from the final result
* ``skip``: 'Number of elements to skip from the beginning (default: 0)
* ``maxitems``: Maximum numbe of items to be returned



.. _element-by-:

element-by-
-----------

The filters **element-by-class**, **element-by-id**, **element-by-style**,
and **element-by-tag** allow you to select all matching instances of a given
HTML element.

Examples:

To extract only the ``<body>`` of a page:

.. code-block:: yaml

   url: https://example.org/bodytag.html
   filter:
     - element-by-tag: body


To extract ``<div id="something">.../<div>`` from a page:

.. code-block:: yaml

   url: https://example.org/idtest.html
   filter:
     - element-by-id: something

Since you can chain filters, use this to extract an element within another element:

.. code-block:: yaml

   url: https://example.org/idtest_2.html
   filter:
     - element-by-id: outer_container
     - element-by-id: something_inside

To make the output human-friendly you can chain html2text on the result:

.. code-block:: yaml

   url: https://example.net/id2text.html
   filter:
     - element-by-id: something
     - html2text: pyhtml2text



.. _html2text:

html2text
-------------

This filter converts HTML (or XML) to plaintext

**Optional directives**
"""""""""""""""""""""""

* ``method``: One of:

   - ``html2text``: Uses the `html2text <https://pypi.org/project/html2text/>`__ Python package (default)
   - ``bs4``: Uses the `BeautifulSoup <https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/>`__ Python package
   - ``re``: a simple regex-based tag stripper


``html2text``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This filter converts HTML into `Markdown <https://www.markdownguide.org/>`__.
using the `html2text <https://pypi.org/project/html2text/>`__ Python package.

It is the recommended option to convert all types of HTML into readable text.

Example configuration:

Note: If the content has tables, adding the sub-directive `pad_tables: true` *may* improve readability.

.. code-block:: yaml

    url: https://example.com/html2text.html
    filter:
      - xpath: '//section[@role="main"]'
      - html2text:
          pad_tables: true

**Optional sub-directives**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* See `documentation <https://github.com/Alir3z4/html2text/blob/master/docs/usage.md#available-options>`__
* Note that the following options are set by default (but can be overridden): ensure that accented
  characters are kept as they are (`unicode_snob: true`), lines aren't chopped up
  (`body_width: 0`), additional empty lines aren't added between sections
  (`single_line_break: true`), and images are ignored (`ignore_images: true`).


``bs4``
^^^^^^^

This filter extract unfromatted text from HTML using the `BeautifulSoup
<https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/>`__, specifically its
`get_text(strip=True)
<https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/#get-text>`__ method.

Note that as of Beautiful Soup version 4.9.0, when lxml or html.parser are in use, the contents of <script>, <style>,
and <template> tags are not considered to be â€˜textâ€™, since those tags are not part of the human-visible content of the
page.

**Optional sub-directives**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* ``parser`` (defaults to ``lxml``): as per `documentation
  <https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/#specifying-the-parser-to-use>`__

**Required packages**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To run jobs with this filter, you need to have additional Python package(s) installed.

Install them using:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install --upgrade webchanges[bs4]

``re``
^^^^^^

A simple HTML/XML tag stripper based on applying a regex.  Very fast but may
not yield the prettiest results.


.. _beautify:

beautify
--------

This filter uses the `BeautifulSoup
<https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/>`__, `jsbeautifier
<https://pypi.org/project/jsbeautifier/>`__ and `cssbeautifier
<https://pypi.org/project/cssbeautifier/>`__ Python packages to reformat an
HTML document to make it more readable.

**Required packages**
"""""""""""""""""""""

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install --upgrade webchanges[beautify]



.. _pdf2text:

pdf2text
------------

This filter converts a PDF file to plaintext using the `pdftotext
<https://github.com/jalan/pdftotext/blob/master/README.md#pdftotext>`__ Python
library, itself based on the `Poppler <https://poppler.freedesktop.org/>`__
library.

This filter *must* be the first filter in a chain of filters.

.. code-block:: yaml

   url: https://example.net/pdf-test.pdf
   filter:
     - pdf2text
     - strip


If the PDF file is password protected, you can specify its password:

.. code-block:: yaml

   url: https://example.net/pdf-test-password.pdf
   filter:
     - pdf2text:
         password: webchangessecret
     - strip

**Optional sub-directives**
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""

* ``password``: password for a password-protected PDF file

"""""""""""""""""""""
To run jobs with this filter, you need to install :ref:`optional_packages`. Install them using:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install --upgrade webchanges[pdf2text]

In addition, you need to install any of the OS-specific dependencies of Poppler (see
`website <https://github.com/jalan/pdftotext/blob/master/README.md#os-dependencies>`__).

Example:

.. code-block:: yaml

   name: Convert PDF to text
   url: https://example.net/sample.pdf
   filter:
     - pdf2text:
         password: pdfpassword



.. _format-json:

format-json
---------------

This filter deserializes a JSON object and reformats it using Python's `json.dumps
<https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html#json.dumps>`__ with indentations.

**Optional sub-directives**
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""

* ``indentation`` (defaults to 4): indent to pretty-print JSON array elements. ``None`` selects the most compact
    representation.



.. _format-xml:

format-xml
----------

This filter deserializes an XML object and reformats it using the `lxml <https://lxml.de>`__ Python package's
etree.tostring `pretty_print <https://lxml.de/apidoc/lxml.etree.html#lxml.etree.tostring>`__ option.




.. _ical2text:

ical2text
---------

This filter reads an iCalendar document and converts them to easy-to read text

.. code-block:: yaml

   name: "Make iCal file readable test"
   url: https://example.com/cal.ics
   filter:
     - ical2text:

**Required packages**
"""""""""""""""""""""

To run jobs with this filter, you need to install :ref:`optional_packages`. Install them using:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install --upgrade webchanges[ical2text]



.. _hexdump:

hexdump
-----------

This filter display the contents both in binary and ASCII (hex dump format).

.. code-block:: yaml

   name: Display binary and ASCII test
   command: cat testfile
   filter:
     - hexdump:



.. _sha1sum:

sha1sum
-----------

This filter calculates a SHA-1 hash for the document,

.. code-block:: yaml

   name: "Calculate SHA-1 hash test"
   url: https://example.com/sha.html
   filter:
     - sha1sum:



.. _keep_lines_containing:

keep_lines_containing
---------------------

This filter *emulates* Linux's `grep` using Pyton's
`regular expression matching <https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html>`__
(regex) and keeps only lines that match the pattern, discarding the others.
Note that mothwistanding its name, this filter **does not** use the executable
`grep`.

Example: convert HTML to text, strip whitespace, and only keep lines that have the sequence ``a,b:`` in them:

.. code-block:: yaml

   name: Keep line matching test
   url: https://example.com/keep_lines_containing.html
   filter:
     - html2text:
     - strip:
     - keep_lines_containing:
         re: 'a,b:'

Example: keep only lines that contain "error" irrespective of its case (e.g. Error, ERROR, etc.):

.. code-block:: yaml

   name: "Lines with error in them, case insensitive"
   url: https://example.com/keep_lines_containing_i.txt
   filter:
     - keep_lines_containing:
         re: '(?i)error'



.. _delete_lines_containing:

delete_lines_containing
-----------------------

This filter is the inverse of ``keep_lines_containing`` above and keeps only lines that do
not match the text or the `regular expression
<https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#regular-expression-syntax>`__,
discarding the others.

Example: eliminate lines that contain "xyz":

.. code-block:: yaml

   name: "Lines with error in them, case insensitive"
   url: https://example.com/delete_lines_containing.txt
   filter:
     - delete_lines_containing: 'xyz'



.. _re.sub:

re.sub
------

This filter removes or replaces text using `regular expressions
<https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#regular-expression-syntax>`__.

1. Just specifying a string as the value will remove the matches.
2. Simple patterns can be replaced with another string using ``pattern`` as the expression and ``repl`` as the
   replacement.
3. You can use regex groups (``()``) and back-reference them with ``\1`` (etc..) to put groups into the replacement
   string.

All features are described in Pythonâ€™s re.sub `documentation <https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.sub>`__.
The ``pattern`` and ``repl`` values are passed to this function as-is.

Just like Pythonâ€™s `re.sub <https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.sub>`__ function, thereâ€™s the possibility to
apply a regular expression and either remove of replace the matched text. The following example applies the filter
3 times:

.. code-block:: yaml

   name: "re.sub test"
   url: https://example.com/re_sub.txt
   filter:
     - re.sub: '\s*href="[^"]*"'
     - re.sub:
         pattern: '<h1>'
         repl: 'HEADING 1: '
     - re.sub:
         pattern: '</([^>]*)>'
         repl: '<END OF TAG \1>'

**Optional sub-directives**
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""

* ``pattern``: pattern to be replaced. This sub-directive must be specified if also using the ``repl`` sub-directive. Otherwise the
  pattern can be specified as the value of ``re.sub``.
* ``repl``: the string for replacement. If this sub-directive is missing, defaults to empty string (i.e. deletes the string
  matched in ``pattern``)



.. _strip:

strip
-----

This filter removes leading and trailing whitespace.  It applies to the entire
document: it is **not** applied line-by line.

.. code-block:: yaml

   name: "Stripping leading and trailing whitespace test"
   url: https://example.com/strip.html
   filter:
     - strip:


.. _sort:

sort
----

This filter performs a line-based sorting, ignoring cases (case folding as per
Python's `implementation <https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.casefold>`__

If the source provides data in random order, you should sort it before
the comparison in order to avoid diffing based only on changes in the sequence.

.. code-block:: yaml

   name: "Sorting lines test"
   url: https://example.net/sorting.txt
   filter:
     - sort

The sort filter takes an optional ``separator`` parameter that defines
the item separator (by default sorting is line-based), for example to
sort text paragraphs (text separated by an empty line):

.. code:: yaml

   url: https://example.org/paragraphs.txt
   filter:
     - sort:
         separator: "\n\n"

This can be combined with a boolean ``reverse`` option, which is useful
for sorting and reversing with the same separator (using ``%`` as
separator, this would turn ``3%2%4%1`` into ``4%3%2%1``):

.. code:: yaml

   url: https://example.org/sort-reverse-percent.txt
   filter:
     - sort:
         separator: '%'
         reverse: true


.. _reverse:

reverse
-------

This filter reverses the order of items (lines) without sorting:

.. code:: yaml

   url: https://example.com/reverse-lines.txt
   filter:
     - reverse

This behavior can be changed by using an optional separator string argument (e.g. items separated by a pipe (``|``)
symbol, as in ``1|4|2|3``, which would be reversed to ``3|2|4|1``):

.. code:: yaml

   url: https://example.net/reverse-separator.txt
   filter:
     - reverse: '|'

Alternatively, the filter can be specified more verbose with a dict. In this example ``"\n\n"`` is used to separate
paragraphs (items that are separated by an empty line):

.. code:: yaml

   url: https://example.org/reverse-paragraphs.txt
   filter:
     - reverse:
         separator: "\n\n"


.. _ocr:

ocr
---

This filter extracts text from images using the `Tesseract OCR engine`_ It requires two Python modules to be installed:
`pytesseract`_ and `Pillow`_. Any file formats supported by Pillow (PIL) are supported.

.. _Tesseract OCR engine: https://github.com/tesseract-ocr
.. _pytesseract: https://github.com/madmaze/pytesseract
.. _Pillow: https://python-pillow.org

This filter *must* be the first filter in a chain of filters, since it consumes binary data and outputs text data.

.. code-block:: yaml

   url: https://example.net/ocr-test.png
   filter:
     - ocr:
         timeout: 5
         language: eng
     - strip

**Optional sub-directives**
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""
* ``timeout``: Timeout for the recognition, in seconds (default: 10 seconds)
* ``language``: Text language (e.g. ``fra`` or ``eng+fra``, default: ``eng``)

**Required packages**
"""""""""""""""""""""

To run jobs with this filter, you need to install :ref:`optional_packages`. Install them using:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install --upgrade webchanges[ocr]

In addition, you need to install `Tesseract <https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Home.html>`__.


.. _shellpipe:

shellpipe
---------

The data to be filtered is passed to a command or script and the output from the script is used.  The environment
variable ``URLWATCH_JOB_NAME`` will have the name of the job, while ``URLWATCH_JOB_LOCATION`` its location
(either URL or command).

.. code-block:: yaml

   url: https://example.net/shellpipe.html
   filter:
     - shellpipe: customscript.py
