.. _jobs:

====
Jobs
====

Jobs are made of the sources that `webchanges` can monitor and the instructions on transformations (filters) to apply
to the data once retrieved.

The list of jobs to run are contained in the configuration file ``jobs.yaml``, a text file editable using any text
editor or with the command ``webchanges --edit``.

While optional, it is recommended that each job starts with a ``name`` entry.  If omitted and the data montiroed is
HTML, `webchanges` will automatically use the pages' title for a name.

.. code-block:: yaml

   name: This is a human-readable name/label of the job
   url: https://example.org/


**About YAML special characters**

Certain characters that could be present in names could have significance in the YAML format (e.g. certain special
characters at the beginning of the line or, anywhere, a ``:`` followed by a space or a space followed by ``#``, all
sort of brackets, and more) and therefore need to either be enclosed in quotes like so:

.. code-block:: yaml

   name: This is a human-readable name/label of the job  # and this is a remark
   name: "This human-readable name/label has a: colon followed by a space and space # followed by hashmark"
   name: "I can escape \"double\" quotes within a double quoted string which also has a colon: followed by a space"

You can learn more about quoting `here <https://www.yaml.info/learn/quote.html#flow>`__ (note: the library we use
supports YAML 1.1, and our examples use "flow scalars").  URLs are always safe and don't need to be enclosed in quotes.


URL
---

This is the main job type -- it retrieves a document from a web server. Multiple jobs are separated by a line
containing three hyphens, i.e. ``---``.

.. code-block:: yaml

   name: Example homepage
   url: https://example.org/
   ---
   name: Example page 2
   url: https://example.org/page2

.. _use_browser:

The use_browser directive
"""""""""""""""""""""""""

If you're monitoring a website, and you need to render its content with JavaScript in order to monitor it, add
the directive ``use_browser: true`` to the job configuration:

.. code-block:: yaml

   name: A page with JavaScript
   url: https://example.org/
   use_browser: true

**IMPORTANT NOTES**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* The optional `Pyppeteer <https://github.com/pyppeteer/pyppeteer>`__ Python package must be installed; run
  ``pip isntall webchanges[use_browser]`` to install it.
* Additional OS-dependent dependencies may be required as well;
  missing dependencies are often the cause of ``pyppeteer.errors.BrowserError:
  Browser closed unexpectedly``. See `here
  <https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/blob/main/docs/troubleshooting.md#chrome-headless-doesnt-launch>`__).
* As this job type
  renders the page in a headless Chromium instance, it requires **massively more resources** and time than a simple
  ``url`` job. Use it only on pages where omitting ``use_browser: true`` does not give the right results.
* Pro TIP: in many instances instead of using ``use_browser: true`` on a page you can monitor the output of an API
  (URL) called by the site during page loading, API which contains the information you're after.  Monitor page load
  with a browser's Developer's Tools (e.g. `Chrome DevTools
  <https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools>`__) to see if this is the case.
* The first time you run a job with ``use_browser:true`` could take some time (and bandwidth) because when
  ``pyppeteer`` needs to download the `Chromium browser
  <https://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/download-chromium>`__ (~150 MiB) if it is not found on the system.
  If you don't prefer this behavior, ensure that a suitable Chrome binary is installed. One way to do this is to run
  ``pyppeteer-install`` command prior to using this library.
* At the moment, the Chromium version used by ``pyppeteer`` only supports macOS (x86_64), Windows (both x86
  and x64), and Linux (x86_64). See `this issue <https://github.com/pyppeteer/pyppeteer/issues/155>`__ in the Pyppeteer
  issue tracker for progress on getting ARM devices supported (e.g. Raspberry Pi).

Command
-------

This job type allows you to watch the output of arbitrary shell commands, which is useful for e.g. monitoring a FTP
uploader folder, output of scripts that query external devices (RPi GPIO), etc...

.. code-block:: yaml

   name: What is in my home directory?
   command: dir -al ~

Required directives
"""""""""""""""""""

- ``command``: The shell command to execute

Optional directives
"""""""""""""""""""

- none

Optional directives (for all job types)
---------------------------------------
These optional directives apply to all job types:

- ``name``: Human-readable name/label of the job. If content is HTML, defaults to tile.
- ``max_tries``: Number of times to retry fetching the resource
- ``diff_tool``: Command to a custom tool for generating diff text
- ``compared_versions``: Number of versions to compare for similarity (see :ref:`here <compared_versions>`):
- ``filter``: :ref:`filters` (if any) to apply to the output (can be tested with ``--test``)
- ``diff_filter``: :ref:`filters` (if any) to apply to the diff result (can be tested with ``--test-diff``)
- ``added_only``: filter unified diff output to keep only addition lines
- ``deleted_only``: filter unified diff output to keep only deleted lines
