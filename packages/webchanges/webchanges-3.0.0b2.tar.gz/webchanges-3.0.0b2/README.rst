`webchanges` checks webpages (or the output of local commands) for changes, and notifies you via e-mail or
one of many other supported services if one is detected. The notification includes the changed URL or command and
a summary of what has changed. This project is a fork of `urlwatch <https://github.com/thp/urlwatch>`__ as suggested
`here <https://github.com/thp/urlwatch/pull/518#discussion_r456885484>`__ and is optimized for HTML, ensuring that it
"just works".

Installation
============

`webchanges` is available on `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/webchanges/>`__ and can be installed using `pip`::

   pip install webchanges

Optional dependencies may be needed; see `here <https://webchanges.readthedocs.io/en/stable/dependencies.html>`__.

Documentation
=============

The documentation is hosted on `Read the Docs <ttps://webchanges.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`__

Code
====

The code and issues tracker are hosted on `GitHub <https://github.com/mborsetti/webchanges>`__

Quick Start
============

#. Run ``webchanges --edit`` to customize your job list (this will create ``jobs.yaml`` and ``config.yaml``)
#. Run ``webchanges --edit-config`` if you want to set up e-mail sending

The interval for checking is defined by how often you run ``webchanges``.  It is recommended to use schedulers to
automatically run `webchanges` periodically:

- In Linux, you can use cron. Use
  `crontab.guru <https://crontab.guru>`__ to figure out the schedule expression for the checking interval, we recommend
  no more often than 30 minutes (this would be ``*/30 * * * *``). If you have never used cron before, check out the
  `crontab command help <https://www.computerhope.com/unix/ucrontab.htm>`__.
- On Windows, use the `Windows Task Scheduler <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Task_Scheduler>`__
  or see `this <https://stackoverflow.com/q/132971/1047040>`__ question on StackOverflow for alternatives.
