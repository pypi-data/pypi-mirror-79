Migration from urlwatch 2.2
===========================

`|project|` |version| is backward compatible with `urlwatch` 2.2 and its configuration files.

The following items are deprecated and will eventually be removed:

* Job key ``kind``: remove
* Job key ``navigate``: use ``url`` and add ``use_browser: true``
* Method ``pyhtml2text`` of filter ``html2text``: use ``html2text`` instead
* Method ``re`` of filter ``html2text``: use ``strip_tags`` instead
* Filter ``grep``: use ``keep_lines_matching`` instead
* Filter ``grepi``: use ``delete_lines_matching`` instead
* Command line ``--test-filter``: use ``--test`` instead
* Command line ``--test-diff-filter``: use ``--test-diff`` instead
* The location of config files in Windows has been moved to ``%USERPROFILE%/Documents/urlwatch``
  where they can be more easily edited and backed up.
* The name of the default job file has been changed to ``jobs.yaml`` (if ``urls.yaml`` is found at startup,
  it is copied over for backward-compatibility).
