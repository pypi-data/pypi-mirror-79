        `webchanges` watches changes in webpages and notifies you (via e-mail or other services) of any
        changes. The change notification will include the URL that has changed and
        a unified diff of what has changed. This project is a fork of `webchanges <https://github.com/thp/webchanges>`__
        as suggested `here <https://github.com/thp/webchanges/pull/518#discussion_r456885484>`__ to optimize it for HTML and
        make it to "just work".
        
        `webchanges` is intended to help you watch changes in webpages or local commands and get notified (via e-mail, in your
        terminal or through various third party services) of any changes. The change notification will inclueds the URL
        that has changed and a unified diff of what has changed.

        Documentation
        =============
        
        The documentation is hosted at: https://webchanges.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
        
        Code
        ====
        
        The code and issue tracker are hosted on GitHub: https://github.com/mborsetti/webchanges
        
        Quick Start
        ============
        
        #. Run ``webchanges --edit`` to customize your job list (this will create/edit ``jobs.yaml``)
        #. Run ``webchanges --edit-config`` if you want to set up e-mail sending
        #. Add ``webchanges`` to your scheduler (e.g. ``crontab -e``) to monitor webpages periodically
        
        The interval is defined by how often you run ``webchanges``.
        
        - In Linux, you can use e.g.
          `crontab.guru <https://crontab.guru>`__ to figure out the schedule expression for the checking interval, we recommend
          no more often than 30 minutes (this would be ``*/30 * * * *``). If you have never used cron before, check out the
          `crontab command help <https://www.computerhope.com/unix/ucrontab.htm>`__.
        - On Windows, use the `Windows Task Scheduler <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Task_Scheduler>`__
          or see `this StackOverflow question <https://stackoverflow.com/q/132971/1047040>`__ for alternatives.
