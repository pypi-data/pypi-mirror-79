# Sypht Python Client
This repository is a Python reference client implementation for working with the Sypht API at https://api.sypht.com.

## About Sypht
[Sypht](https://sypht.com) is a SaaS [API]((https://docs.sypht.com/)) which extracts key fields from documents. For 
example, you can upload an image or pdf of a bill or invoice and extract the amount due, due date, invoice number 
and biller information. 

## Getting started
To get started you'll need API credentials, i.e. a `<client_id>` and `<client_secret>`, which can be obtained by registering
for an [account](https://www.sypht.com/signup/developer)

## Installation
Latest version is available via pypi:

```
pip install sypht
```

## Usage
```python
from sypht.client import SyphtClient, Fieldset

sc = SyphtClient('<client_id>', '<client_secret>')

with open('invoice.png', 'rb') as f:
    fid = sc.upload(f, fieldsets=["document", "invoice"])

print(sc.fetch_results(fid))
```

or run it in the command line:

```
$ sypht extract --fieldset sypht.document --fieldset sypht.bank path/to/your/document.pdf
```
